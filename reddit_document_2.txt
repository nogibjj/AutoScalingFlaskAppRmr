IST Champs ✅️

Ohtani a Dodger ✅️ 

Can't be anything but a great time to be alive!
Post-IST lineup thoughtsLooks like Ham is rolling with this rotation rn:

Dlo/Reaves

Cam/Reaves/Christie

TP/Vando/Cwood

Bron/Rui/Vando/CWood

AD/Hayes

We have good depth, Pelinka did a good job. Great defensive team. Still missing Vincent too

We could use an upgrade at center. Hayes has been a decent defensive disrupter but offers nothing offensively. Wood has been pretty bad. 

Ham hasn’t played Rui many minutes. He’s basically a Bron sub. Hoping that’s only bc of his surgery and he gets more minutes at the 3 too. TP eats up a lot of those minutes now. Advanced stats don’t like TP on either end of the court so curious why Rui isn’t getting a chance

Don’t think this team needs a big trade at the deadline. But trading Vincent for Caruso would be a home run IMOAnyone able to order those championship hats? Can’t find them but they are advertised everywhere
Rui and D’Lo are expandable and will be traded if there’s an upgrade available as we need more shooting and scoring
Getting Gabe Vincent back &amp; acquiring back up big man should be our priority
Weak point is easily backup C. Jaxson looked serviceable last night, but I don’t trust him in high stakes matches. Not sure who’s out there to target; wouldn’t be opposed to see Castleton get some run over the next few weeks as I expect Bron and AD to cool down from the tourney.

I do think the Rui fit is unfortunately redundant but it’d be hard to trade him after seeing what he did in the playoffs. 

Caruso, like you said, would be great to have back but that’s just way too many non-shooters in one rotation for me.
Backup center needs to be addressed
Dear ESPN, don’t do this again.I was honestly in disbelief when the game started and they didn’t stop this side commentary or full screen the game. Horrible way to watch a game.I was looking for an ABC stream with the quickness when I saw it wasn’t going away
Trying to mimic the MNF Manning Cast but chose absolutely the wrong people
Pat Bev talking about Josh Giddey lmfao
Pat Bev asking them what they think about Josh Giddey was the highlight of this dogshit presentation
I flipped to this channel for a couple minutes in the 4th and those couch fuck boys were trying to shade LeBron 


I was like “wtf is this trash” - pathetic, and Hart seems buzzed af and exhausted

Only dope thing was Pat Bev asking them about Josh Giddey lol
Yeah ABC was way better, the ESPN one was obnoxious. I turned it off almost instantly
You watched the whole game on the wrong channel 😂
Ya it was awful I couldn’t even focus on watching the game. Who tf would watch this ? It’s not even quality analyst it’s just guys goofin around lol. 

I think the only reason they did it is so they could have pat bev come on and ask them about the giddey situation.
Theres a reason they called this segment ‘Unplugged’
They thought they’d be able to do the same in the nba like they did the manning cast for football. And it just didn’t work the same. Hopefully they just say k we tried. It was a miss let’s not do that again lol
Or just watch the main broadcast then? There's a reason it was on ESPN2.
You should of switched to the abc broadcast. The espn2 broadcast was intended to be like this.
If you Google “Lakers”, you will find that the IST championship is being celebrated with purple and gold fireworks 💥If you Google “Shohei” it rains dollar sign$$$.
W
Thats watsup
LFG
My boys did it and everyone is gonna downplay this like they were the 2020 ring smh.
This is a ridiculous stat man. Most clutch player in history.We are so spoiled with him
Let’s make it 10 in June
Still gonna dominate in his 40s. Might even do it in his 50s.
LeOver
Im confused? Which games are included in winner takes all games?
Daily Lakers Discussion ThreadThe 2023-2024 Lakers season is underway. Talk about whatever you want.I think it’ll mean a lot to Cam that the Lakers have been the first organization in his career that have fully believed in him and fully empowered him to succeed. Hopefully Cam will want to stay here this summer and either exercise his player option or LAL can structure a new deal for him. 

I got called a dumbass all summer for saying context matters for players and that ppl shouldn’t be so quick to write him off. 

Atlanta’s Trae-centric system is a horrible ecosystem for player development. Thibs was set in benching Cam before Cam even got to NY. Portland was tanking and had zero direction or veteran leadership.

Edit: respect to Cam for buying into the team and doing all the small things like hustling after loose balls. Fighting over screens and fighting every play on defense.
Let me remind all of you of something:

We still have Gabe Vincent coming back from injury.
We need to trade Gabe for Steph, Hood schafino for KD and Castleton for Jokic
Im not going to pretend that the in season tournament is anything close to a ring, but I hate how online discourse has tried to delegitimize our win. If it were their team, they’d be super excited.

It’s also a testament to how good this team is. Theres still work to do, but I think that we’re going to be very scary in the postseason as is (assuming there aren’t any trades coming our way).
I'm looking at our schedule again this month and holy fucking shit, 3 B2Bs in 3 straight weeks. Like who tf came up with this schedule in December? Two of them are against the Wolves that we need to put down so bad.
Taking the media shine away from Denver so quickly feels so good 😂😂💜💛
I wish Rui or Wood could start. I wanna see Rui take the leap as a starter like Reaves did last season
Can we have a convo about Rui and what his true role is?
Imo him and Wood while predicted to play huge roles haven’t gotten much of a shot to contribute as much as we thought.
Rui imo can be that 13-18 ppg 2 way who grabs 6-8 boards a game guy but Ion feel he gets the chances he legit got the rock 1 time last game. He provides grit and power but he hasn’t been able to get going. I think part of it is this.

When u have Bron and AD on ur team they gon be the main scorers. U want Bron to take a backseat but he too good. Id rather Bron be chill then turn up late game but he not slowing down anytime soon. Reaves handles the bench scoring meaning the rest have to do other things. DLO can score cuz he a natural shooter. Rui needs the ball so he def became the odd ball. However I feel if he can start over Prince the team would be better.
We need to give lebron and ad off the next game, please ham
Sometimes I forget why people hate on us more than they cheer for their own teams, but then I remember their teams give them nothing to cheer for.
Man yesterday was the best feeling I had since 2020 chip, LA got Ohtani and we won the IST with most importantly AD playing authority and dominance
I just realized Rob could resign BI in a few years if he hits FA// BI could request a trade and we could match it// either way Rob and Brandon Ingram/ the lakers have the chance to do the funniest shit ever in a few years.
DLo's passing is utterly insane and I feel like it's legit never even talked about. 

Just unreal shit
Our coaching team turned our lack of three point shooting into a strength. No threes means no long rebounds. Instead we drove into the paint, went for higher efficiency shots, and got free throws. We prevented them from getting their offense in, dominated the glass, and were able to control the entire game.
People big mad we won last night 🤣🤣🤣

Also why is C wood unplayable 🤔
It’s clear that our biggest weakness is the backup center position 

Then a wing who can actually create for themselves. I like Rui but he gets no play time either

Then a more defensive guard but our defense is incredible with tons of POA anyway

I say we go after Drummond or Vuc or Gafford or Nik Richards as someone mentioned. All depending on how much resources our FO wants to allocate toward that position 

And Jerami Grant

Downvoted by people who think we’ll win the chip as constructed. How’s Wood and Hayes working out? Lmao
kyrie is injured
Once Rui gets back into his groove it’s over for the league. Also once Gabe comes back, I think he will be better defensively and offensively as there’s not much pressure on him now that we have a healthy squad (knock on wood)
This tournament has been a great playoff like experience for the guys
Bron really about to have 6 chips

![gif](giphy|3QWfMsI8IaarXxtBt6|downsized)
If winning the title in 2020 felt like a 10/10 on the hype scale. 

Yesterday felt like a strong 8 to be honest.
Was like a throw back to 2020 AD. If he played with that aggression and passion more often we’d be the first seed easily and one of the favorites to win it. 

It’s what’s annoying about all the “you aren’t allowed to criticize AD when he has 0 points in an entire half against a team with no center”. The dude is capable of being a monster. He doesn’t need to be a 40/20 guy every night but the 0 points in a half shit is inexcusable. He’s too good for that type of play.
Can someone make an updated version of Vando’s vault and add Tyrese?
So when is the parade?
Go Lakers 😤🔥🙏💜💛
IMO the morale / chemistry boost that we are going to get for this win is the most underrated prize of IST.
Anyone catch KG talking shit to haterass Paul Piece for saying Lebron isn’t top 5 in the league right now:

[
Man we are set and our D is legit.

We just need one more big and we are set.

We do not need Lavine or Caruso.

Option 1:

Nick Richards - Hornets - 5m salary - 26 yrs

Can trade JHS straight up.

Option 2: 

Vucevic - Bulls - 18m salary - 34 yrs

Can trade Gabe + Prince.

Option 3 : 

Gafford - Wizards - 12m salary - 25 years

Gabe + 3 2nds should get it done.

My favorite option is Vucevic he can space the floor and can create for others like Marc Gasol.

Average defensively but can torch other teams with 3's
I really enjoy the win but why do we pay Rui if Mr.Pimple Head won't let him play? He's our 4/5-th best player...
That was a ton of fun! 

Now onto the Mavs and Spurs. The Lakers have a really good shot to take all three games this week (especially if Kyrie is out for the Mavs game) and move back up to the 3rd seed.
I love this team
IST turned out to be a good idea. I'm into it. Also dope that the 1st one went to the Lakers. Our name is the NBA and it's always good to cement that legacy wherever we can.

Idea to commemorate NBA Cup if there is no bannerWas thinking since I don’t think the Lakers are gonna raise a banner for the NBA Cup, maybe the Lakers should keep the in season tournament court when they use the black unis as sort of a way to celebrate the winning the NBA CupPut another Laker banner at the clippers arena
Maybe add a super tiny IST champ logo to their jersey..
No thanks to the tournament court, plus I doubt the league would allow them to use it outside of the IST. The whole point of those courts is for the tourney. Just hang a banner, albeit a smaller one on put it on the other side of the arena from the title banners
I'm petty. So I think they should hang a huge banner in Crypto just so The Clippers have to waste time and money to cover it.
Just put like a diamond on the regular court or something with 23 in it.
Why celebrate? It is just a marketing scheme to get viewership up for early regular season games, which usually is their worse time of year for viewership because of football.

Was cool the games had a playoff feel and is great experience for younger players or players who have never experienced a playoff run and for the two way guys/rookies/league minimum guys as the 500k means way  more to them and for Lebron to add one more thing to his legacy, but really the tournament win meant nothing just added wins to the regular season record.  I thought it was hilarious they were popping bottles in the locker room etc like they just won the NBA title.  Stay focused and go win the real prize.
The future is looking bright lolBallsack sports they just refuse to miss...
Just realized Max Christie is only 20. Bro couldnt even drink the champagne after winning the IST 😂
This made me actually lol. Good job
Legoat is gonna end up playing with Bryce at this point
You had me at the top 2. Then you really got me with bottom left 💀💀
Hahahahhaah this 🤌

NBA Cup Game Notes: Lakers v Pacers (12/9/23)These are my game notes. Use them for discussion, disagreement, confirmation, eye test recap, whatever.


Takeaways: This team is very, very difficult team to score on. They are everywhere defensively bc of their combined length and footspeed. This team has defensive potential that could exceed 2019/2020. They go on insane defensive streaks and move on a fucking string. It’s also crazy that our team either shoots 50% or 15% from 3, no in between so far. We will need to be slightly more consistent from 3 if we want to compete for the championship.



Players:


- AD: Absolute MASTERCLASS. He was aggressive offensively throughout (even hit a middie early). When AD’s “on,” it almost looks like AD is dancing - he’s so fluid. Abused Turner early and often and was still disrupting EVERYTHING defensively. It’s a damn shame he hasn’t won DPOY. That scowl in the 4Q. Fucking AD masterclass.


- Bron: Came to play. Played aggressive D and dad-dicked the Pacers inside. Whenever I feel even a smidge nervous, I remember we have Bron lol. He’s still our skeleton key when he needs to be. 


- Rui: limited mins. Quiet game. Fine to let him acclimate slowly bc we are DEEP.


- AR: Came out aggressive. Went into his bag in 1H. Relatively quiet 2H. Solid flu game. Wasn’t a sieve defensively either.


- DLO: Faced his demons. Set the tone early by aggressively going at Brown. Good defense too - was disruptive. Played on a mission even if his shot wasn’t falling. Althoughhhhh he did hit a few key clutch buckets!!!


- Prince: alrightttt, didn’t know you run in transition too lol. Was otherwise focused on defense.


- Vando: Pressed Hali full court on first play in game, and Hali tried to push him off but couldn’t move him an inch lol. Brought defensive intensity with high motor. You can tell Hali was trying very hard to get Vando off him.


- Max: Hesitated on a 3 early. - clearly nervous. Settled in and played well. Some mistakes (back court violation, poor positioning as a help defender),  but I’m more forgiving of homegrown talent. This is how he’ll learn. I wonder if that’s why Ham gave him extended mins this game.


- Hayes: had a poor game - dropped passes, missed reads, not rebounding well.


- Wood: DNP. Hope he continues to handle DNPs well.


- Cam: Played well against Hali. Defense is suffocating - he’s an unbelievable athlete. Shot was not falling until big 4Q shot! Either way, he brought A LOT of value everywhere else.The play that I thought made me the happiest and most positive and reminiscent about the 2020 championship team was about 4:30 left in the fourth when Halliburton penetrated the lane and kicked it out to a wide open corner three from Turner. And AD closed out like 2020 forcing Turner to put the ball on the ground and pass out. The fact that AD closed out hard, and was able to stop his momentum on a dime and not blow by Turner who if that happened had an open lane to dunk. It reminded me of 2020 where AD was not only a force inside but was amazing guarding the perimeter and switching out.
Only thing Cam should avoid after making a good tap at the ball is he seems to try to push off, he got called 2 fouls because of that. Just feels he doesn't have to do that motion. Other than that, he sure did locked up Hali most of the time.
The thing that pops most on this team is length. You go from Cam to Vando to Max to Prince to Rui and THEN you end up against AD or Bron. Idk how many teams have this luxury. 

It can't be overstated how this team shut down Devin Booker, Brandon Ingram, and then Tyrese Halliburton. Like the national media might gloss over that shit, but don't forget it. We went up against 3 legit offenses and completely fucked them up.
If Vando would have made that dunk I would have legally changed my last name.
You dont think Wood deserve playing time over Hayes or youre completely fine with Hayes as your official back up 5?
Anyone saw it when AD got mad at Max for that careless back court violation pass then like on the next possession Vando got mad at him cause of late defensive help on Haliburton, Haliburton scored the layup with ease on that posession. Hes like their youngest brother now, it was kinda funny to see
"Tell me about in season tournament AD grandpa"Babe…wake up. AD and Reaves started cookin
Lakers can potentially win a trebleNBA Cup: ✅ 

NBA regular season

NBA Finals

i know people don’t care about regular season record, but now it might matter a little more knowing we can be the first team ever to win a treble.Stop trying to make treble happen. It’s not going to happen.
No one has ever cared about the best regular season record for decades that the finals have existed. Whereas, there is still time for the NBA cup to be meaningful.
We are not winning the best record in the league and we don't have to. I would much rather have LeBron and AD go off in the playoffs than have them get burnt out.


But with the way they're playing now, who knows? Maybe we do get the best record if AR and DLO goes nuclear, and with Reddish and Vando anchoring our defense, letting Bron and AD coast a little towards the end. 



I'm more excited and hopeful for LeBron to win all the MVPs. Regular Season MVP might be a little hard but WCF MVP and Finals MVP are likely if we can keep this up.
Bro keep already calling it rigged. Ever heard of
Skap attack
Cam’s Defence was Big TimeHope he’s found a long term home here.
Homie found his way
Glad to have him and Vando for Jamal
Wearing black AF1s give you a reputation on the streets for a reason. He came ready to do the dirty work.

Great victory but job’s far from over. On to the next 💜💛
Lakers could end up being the first team to win the IST and NBA title in the same seasonWith our defense looking top notch, and the fact Bron and AD looked like their 2020 self, I couldn’t help but reminisce on the 2020 season. 

Back in 2020, when the lakers traded for AD expectations were high. It was a newly assembled team that just added Quinn Cook, Avery Bradley, Danny Green, Rondo, Dwight Howard and Javale McGee, with a few role players like KCP and Caruso coming back from the season before and you have Lebron James ofc. 

You could tell when the lakers were winning games by large margins, and having an undefeated record of winning games when leading into the third, this team was no joke.
And this team ended up going all the way to a title. 

Now this year, this team is newly assembled,in free agency lakers got Taurean, Gabe,Hayes, cam, and C wood. And you also have returning role players like Rui, DLo, Reaves, and Vando. And ofc we have the stars AD and Bron. 

The difference is this time a majority of this core has proven themselves in the playoffs. And now, with the win at the IST, the main core and the newly added players have proven themselves on a competitive scene. Keeping opponents under 95pts per game on average (I might be a bit off on the average).

The vibes felt pretty similar to 2020. 

Locked up opponents ✅ 
Bron carrying ✅ 
Vintage AD ✅ 
Defense looking spectacular ✅ 

Defense wins championships. From here on out I’m excited for the rest of the season with this squad.Have the Lakers lost any game this season when leading entering the 4th? That’s the stat we need to talk about.
Denver Lakers again at wcf
I don't wanna jinx anything
Let's not get to far ahead. We still got to see how well we matchup against teams like Boston or Denver, but we're making good progress in the right direction.
IST win: ✅ 

Win the NBA season(best record): 

Win the title

potential treble???
For me the only concern is outside shooting, do we have enough 3 point scorers in the team?
Love the Lakers. Do you know when Gabe is expected to return?
No doubt we will. This a year of destiny I just feel it
Lakers only made 2 threes last night imagine how poor we shoot against the nuggets 💀
We're finally close to getting back to our true identity in 2020 after tumultuous years of experimentations. Suffocating Hard nosed DEFENSE so that Lebron and AD can do what they do best and that's pummel teams left and right like hammer and anvil.
Why is this labeled 'shitpost?' It's what I expect.
Cant wait for Gabe to get healthy so we can really see the full potential of this team
Squad that believes in each other, coach that believes in them,  I'm loving this season through ups and downs.
[Video] Ham to DLO on SportsCenter: “Midrange Killer! Two of the biggest midrange shots (in the 4th) baby!”Ham reminds me in a lot of ways of Dave Robert’s. Player friendly. Really gets teams to buy in. Questionable decision making at times but ultimately seems like the right fit for our team and the direction we’re going.
And in the game thread 80% of the posts wanted him out or traded. Makes me crazy
Very good first quarter and he was clutch in the 4th. He got me nervous mid game, but he had 2 nice assists to Davis in the 1st and 2 more down the stretch. This is what I expected from a starting PG. He also had a couple of nice defensive plays and like I always say his scoring is a plus and his two quick baskets when Indiana was looking for a run turned the momentum of the game.
This is the piece people constantly overlook with Ham. He genuinely cares for his players and hypes them up.
HELL YES. I love to see that recognized. My gosh we needed those.

Fuck Bruce Brown.
Truth. They needed those buckets.
Wholesome
LeGOAT to Padre TimeI hope they let him host again, when he retires
Best assist of the night. No Cap. (Or Yes Cap?)One more assist for the record books
On point... Not easy given the weight and shape of a cap.
At first I thought, wow he must not really like how the cap looks.

Christian Wood DNP-CIs Christian Wood okay? Is he injured? Did Ham or anyone talk the DNP-C as of late for Wood

Has Wood said anything?  Is it a match up thing? Ham trying to figure out rotations with our wings back?How much 🪵 could a 🪵 chuck cut
Gabe will probably be doing the same or taking Max minutes when he's back. You can't play everyone.
Wood apparently is now considered a full-time 4 since Rui's return, so he's now playing behind Bron, Vando, and Rui.
Rui just played 8 mins. tonight and you expect Wood to play?
I still would start rui over prince personally
Hayes is just better at defense than Wood and they already have to many guys who need the ball on offense.
We can't play both Hayes and Wood with the wings we have. I'm not saying Hayes has played well, but he has improved, and Wood has started to force things. I think AD and LeBron will miss a couple of games now that the tournament is over, so Wood will have a chance to get back into a rhythm and form. 

Our depth is awesome.
I think it’s as simple as different games calling for different adjustments
With everybody healthy someone’s gotta take the fall for now. Strictly matchup dependent and tn Vando deserved his minutes.
Wood will be needed in certain matchups and especially when AD misses games. I hope he stays ready and produces the way Lonnie did.
They say cause Hayes is much better on chasing smaller players..
We needed our wings more against the Pacers so I guess that's the reason why he's not being played, he'll probably get more minutes in slower teams
Wood has been great cheering on his teammates from the bench even with the DNPs. Hoping he’ll get his Lonnie Walker the IVth game down the road.
D’Angelo Russell gets revenge on Bruce Brown: ‘Jokic ain’t there next to you today’[ it be funny if Bruce Brown becomes a Laker lol notice every Laker player that beefs becomes teammates.

YEAAA DLO LET YO NUTS HANG
LMFAO called him a Jokic merchant. Yeah talk your shit D’lo
Man dlo pisses me off so much, his IQ on defense is horrible.
Bruce Brown is a dummy, D'Angelo is 10x a better player
Love the fire Dlo. Now play with the same fire against the Nuggets.
I want more chip on the shoulder DLo.
Mr. HIMHow can anyone have a discussion about trading this gift from God ? Some of us don’t deserve HIM
This mofo thrives in tense playoff atmosphere games.
He really reminds me of Toby Maguire ngl
Personally wanna say “F ya’ll” to the clowns on this sub who wanted to trade him weeks ago.

Guys go through slumps and he played all summer. He just needed time.

Every championship level team has a player like him.
BIG TIME PLAYER MAN!!!!! TURNS IT UP A NOTCH IN BIG MOMENTS.

USC game today going to be wild. Hope he brjngs the cup with him.
Sigh, old man has to do everything himself

Young guns can't even jizz properly
Ham stopped Vando in a hallway back in Milwaukee and said I hope I get to coach you one day, I love the way you play. Says same thing happened with Cam— "I got to see Cam guard Khris Middleton in the ECF. Not only did he play elite defense, he was knocking down 3s. He always stuck in my mind."Great players coach
The chef stopped Kelvin Benjamin in the hallway in the Golden Corral and said I hope I get to cook for you one day, I love the way you feast. Same thing happened with Zion- "I got to see Zion guard the roast beef line at the Hometown Buffet. Not only did he eat all the gristle, he was chugging down milkshakes. He always stuck in my mind."
Not sure why Ham gets so much shit, we weren’t beating Denver and we look pretty good this season.
You can see why they play hard for this dude.
I know we shit on Ham a lot around here (myself included) but one thing we have to give him credit for is that he gets guys to buy in on defense. He even convinced Dlo to be a good defender, which is just crazy
Darvin's rotations and TO calls might be iffy and Lakers' offense being kinda meh is something Darvin needs to be criticized for.....

But man, this guy has got to be one of the best ever players' coach right now. The way he amps up the players must give them a massive confidence boost.
Ham is an incredible motivator and he and his staff do a tremendous job of creating roles for players. He also outcoached Carlisle tonight.
Shout out to Cam Reddish, from a deer in the headlights at the start to being a lock down defender while getting better he's pretty much earned this bonus and admiration from fans and media. Still need to work on your spots and lean up but he's pretty much earned a future contract.
Im the hallway and I confirm
Ham has been tampering for years. 😂

AR is our Ginobili.
Yall gotta stop playing lol Jerry averaged 27/7 for his whole career. Chipped on 2.7 steals. Per game! Austin got so far to go for this talk lol
Something that is being overlooked a bit is that Anthony Davis is relatively healthy.Such a huge thing for us to be injury free so far. Yeah dudes go through nagging hits but so far his health is holding up extremely well. Very proud to see that out of AD.Someone always has to say it out loud, jesus
Let’s not talk about health rn man lol let’s get stronger
You just haaaaad to say something
I think the depth in this team allows Bron and AD to distribute the load. So that's good
Between last year's regular season, last year's playoffs and this regular season + IST, AD has played in 70 of the Lakers' last 74 games :)
They should rest him and bron occasionally, they deserve it
AD is chasing the DPOY this year, so he's targeting 65 games
we might see a hobbled LeBron the next few games. McConnel hurt his knee this game
It’s early December, his body will break down soon…screaming I’m him I’m him he’s half man half season since 2020/2021 season
It can’t be overstated enough that when AD is healthy he’s insanely good. I bet he’s playing through some minor stuff but when he’s healthy and locked in like this it feels like he’s prime Wilt Chamberlain or Hakeem Olajuwon (google prime Hakeem and there’s a reason guys like Kobe, Dwight Howard, and recently Giannis and Alperen Sengun on the Rockets have trained with him because he had the greatest footwork of any big man) sorry to get side tracked…again it’s the consistency with AD because the thing with him is some nights he looks like this and the next game it’s 21 and 9 rebounds or 19 and 8 rebounds and then there’s a 32 and 14 performance and you say “why can’t we get this every game?”

Upcoming games against the Wolves on the 21st and OKC on the 23rd and the Celtics on Christmas will show us what this team is capable of
I will shoot any monkey paw that tries to curl
It’s hard to tell. AD admittedly wants to play every single game. You never know if he’s playing through an injury or not unless he visibly limping up and down the floor. Last year he was diagnosed with foot tendinitis which is the type of thing that can come and go especially when it he overuses those foot tendons. 

Which is why it should be a goal to build enough cushion where we can load manage some of his games throughout the season.
Delete this rn with your voodoo jinx thread
Favorite AD moment of the ISTOne of my favorite AD moments ever.
2020 AD roar
Call it hype, call it a temporary high, but this team is a contender if healthyRui isn’t even fully healthy yet. Once he is, and once Vincent comes back, this team will be one of the scariest teams in the league. I’m not even scared of Denver at this point, if Bron was healthy last year we win against them and win the finals. Bring it onMeh .... im worried they start going back to 2 small guard lineups with vincent as opposed to staying big which has led to this streak 

Gabe was petty shit when he was playing
Yeah we are obviously contenders. 13-4 when we are missing less than 4 rotation players. Tied for 3rd in a stacked west while consistently missing players the whole year. Lebron playing his best ball in a long time. I think we would be underdogs against Denver and Boston, but absolutely have the personnel to beat them
Ain't hype. Facts only.
Stay on the WEEEEEEEEEEDUH
Why would it be crazy to call us contenders? Lakers only just got relatively healthy and we're tied for 3rd on the conference. We're for sure a contender.
They should be scared, look at what they did in the IST, a do-or-die playoff atmosphere, won it all with suffocatong defense. Offense not even at its peak yet.
Bron &amp; Rui vibing 🙌I don't think Rui has ever stopped dancing in this game while chanting Gojira! Gojira! Gojira ! Lmao
Damn I really want Vincent back. He's going to make our defense much more suffocating.

Love that O face
Well deserved. Sorry for ever doubting you.
oh Cam... 😏

Cam + Vando = GOOD LORDimagine being an elite wing or guard and you get cam out of the game and then here comes vando, then vandos out and heres cam again! blow past either and there is AD.Once you get through Vando or Cam, LeBron is waiting. Once you get through LeBron, AD will be waiting. Just beautiful
Hali has a bright future ahead of him but last game had him work so hard. If he's getting through the defense of Cam or Vando then has to find another way to get through LeBron and AD.
I can’t believe at one point Cam had to sit and it made me anxious, but then Vando came on and for a split second my thought was I guess he’ll do. We stacked
You take risks to get past them and you have DLo, our deflections leader, who’ll make you pay for the risks.
And Hachimura isn’t even in peak form yet either
We have a next game vs mavs. With cam and vando being here. It would help a lot defending luka. We didn't have either of them last mavs game..
man, Reddish is a revelation this season. Can't believe we got two wings that makes life hell for ball handlers. That's not including Gabe who's a great defender against opposing PG too.
Don’t forget after Cam and Vando, Christie pulls up and starts giving you hell. Absolute goon squad
This defense is terrifying i love it. If this team even shoots average from 3, the flood gates open and will blow teams out of the arena. 🔥🔥🔥
Smothered that team tonight.
Gabe is a pretty good guard defender, which will make the perimeter defense even better once he gets back
They’re like the bash bros from the mighty ducks
They cover so many positions, add in AD and the 3 of them cover everyone.
Offense wins games but defence wins championships 💪💪
It's insane. Then you got professional defenders in Prince and Max. AR and Dlo might not be great, but they're big. 

Oh and LeBron James is somewhere on the floor too lmao
MOMENTUM. CHEMISTRY. We just needed to be healthy. This win will be a motivator. We’re the defending champsLol i just noticed they put maxwell lewis on there twice. Damn they really didn’t proof check it. 😂
Oh snappp... they did Vando DIRTY!!! 😭🤣
On to the next stop - nba champions
[Jovan Buha] LeBron yelling to Austin Reaves as Reaves does media in the locker room: “Who had the better flu game: AR or MJ?! It’s up for debate!”Uh oh.  How is Skip going to handle AR's flu game against MJ's?  My guess is that he won't even bring it up.  He'll just bag on LBJ.
MJ was hungover
Did he forget about Dirk?
LMAO
MJ: And I took that personal. Ring the MOFO now, I'm getting ready. Who was that again? Austin Briefs ?? Whoever is that call the mofo up now and send him here.  
  
Personal Butler: But MJ, didn't you just beat the hella crap of that CEO an hour ago, you need to calm down and rest your legs.  
  
Personal Butler (turning to the camera): The CEO beat him bad, it was a one-sided beat down, but nobody is allowed to say that or we're going one on one with him too till mid night. He doens't stop until he wins. So we let the boss win.
[deleted]
Damn it just when I thought I could not love LeBron more... 🥹🥹
Bron memes like the rest of us.
AR had a real flu

MJ had food poisoning lol
Reaves 60% shooting in an elimination game. 

MJ 48% in a non-elimination game.
&gt;It’s up for debate!

It isn’t.

Reaves did.
Sounds like a skip got a new segment headline for his show.
The league been warnedSki goggles required for epic runs.  GO LAKERS!
I looking forward to the Kings, Sixers and Nuggets matchups.
![gif](giphy|Qy2VKY3xlI1QyR6Ix5)

Haven't watched much this season because that last playoffs hurt, hope this team does better against the chicken Nuggets this year, team looks great
Imagine we just won and became the 1st champion in the very first in-Season Tournament in the NBA, then we get greedy and win the NBA Championship too. It's champ champ baby! GReatest Lakers season ever.
Yea sucks that we're going to be back on the radar for sure. 
But I'll take this first IST for now.
These two just put their heads down and ran to the front of the hoop at full speed and said try and stop us.
Media: lakers will now have a target every night. 

Bro we been having a target. Teams never miss when they play us and the guy no one knows on their bench will have a career night.
[Haynes] LeBron James told me Cam Reddish is the player he wanted to have this IST championship platform to showcase his skillset: “People were writing him off. I’m so happy he got to experience this and perform. I believe in him.”LeLeader
Imagine if the Lakers got him from the draft. He'd be getting All Defensive Team accolades
LeTutor and LeMentor
Imagine how Cam must feel hearing Bron say this about him! It’s gotta be so encouraging!
Real Leadership!
Idk how but I hope we can keep him around. He's been so good. Dude deserves a spot in the league for sure. Crazy to see what a good environment can do for these guys.
I'm ready to give him the full MLE next year and I'm afraid he'll get a better offer. He's the KCP replacement we've needed for years.
AD Apology Form. Haters submit this form asap…TMNT Leonardo himself
Everytime this post comes up, AD produces another stinker offensively going 3-10. lol
Every time
This is why Chris Ryan called him “The Boy Who Broke Basketball Reference” during his Pels stint , MAMA THERE GOES THAT MAAAAAAN. God that game must be akin to a hit of that Walter white blue meth
These posts are so trite.
[deleted]
We have to be very clear that AD is a defensive guy first. What we get out of him offensively is a bonus. Thinking he is anything more than that is wrong. Yeah we'll see a monster game in points one night and then another game where it's like 15 pts. That monster game makes us believe that's him every night but in reality, we have to go back to the first point where scoring is secondary for him.        

I think what we most have to be proud of AD is his health. So far he has been relatively healthy this season and hopefully he keeps it up. A healthy AD means we are damn near unstoppable.
forward it to lil wayne
I want to go on record and say I've never been an AD hater. Anyone dissing AD doesn't know basketball. Favorite player currently in the league and has been since he put on the purple and gold.
I just wanna say, "STFU, Stephen A Smith. Hating ass motherfucker."
[deleted]
Yup all you Charles Barkley ass niggas come in here and say sorry asap
This was a great Game 7 type feel for the LakersThis should give the whole Lakers squad a good feel for the playoffs, and for an elimination game as well! They also got a taste of winning the finals, so now they have experience to what they are eventually going for! Congrats Lakers, we did it!



Especially AD, thank you for your monster performance! Lebron was great the whole tournament (IST MVP), AR was clutch this game, and we had great role players providing defense and offense when needed! Now let’s get the real thing!They flat out dominated going 7-0, had the highest  points win differential. Perhaps all this team needed was some motivation.
Reddish made some boneheaded mistakes, but I also love that he showed a capacity to make some clutch plays too.

For better or worse, he's fearless. And we need guys like that.
Congrats to Lebron and the Lakers. What a winLeVegas sure has a nice ring to it
Look how salty that are..Aren’t they just calling it meaningless because of their coach’s post game interview though? Either way they’re not salty, they’re just sad over the outcome.
They think Halburton is gonna stay ? He’s going to bounce as soon as they don’t go anywhere in 2-3 years and he wants to join a real franchise . Plus , nobody wants to live in Indiana
I mean its aight. Let them do they thing. They haven't won shit, and coming close to one has got to suck. They actually in good hands with Haliburton. Cant hate the kid, very down to earth, baller
Don’t know why this sub cares so much about other teams fans.

Maybe I’m just older and more mature than a lot of you, but stop caring. Who gives a f about what they think?
Most of them are Nuggets/ Suns / Kings / Pelicans/ Clippers fans.

They can't watch us win.

But I'm loving the salt tho.

Enough salt for my days meal.
Lol let them be. All it matter lakers won and we are catching up on the standing too..
![gif](giphy|34tTvrt0nIhZbcBvp6|downsized)

This how we looking at em G 😂, and tell em to ask Halliburton if that was meaningless. I say that as a person typing this from Indiana who likes Tyrese as much as anyone
I dunno man, I didn't see much saltiness in there... mostly just sadness. In fact, most of the comments seem to be a mixture of being sad about their own performance or being happy they made it this far.

Go to a fuckin vs. Phoenix or vs. Clippers game thread next time. It's the Dead Sea in those.
*insert reggie miller choking meme*
Honestly it was kinda sad in there. Those are the bumps and bruises of young teams tho. Hali needs a legit star at the wing before they make real noise in the playoffs
if we lost id be salty too tbh. at least they have a legit young MVP caliber guy going forward
Doesn’t speak for all of us. Some of us are grateful that we even made it this far and that the game was close. AD and Bron were just unstoppable tonight. Thanks for giving us a challenge.

I’ll be waiting for the IST Final rematch in the meantime, tho….
They say you wont find IST on the record books, but you also wont find any Pacers NBA championship on any record books lmao
Man Haliburton is really good, despite Vando and Cam hounding him whole.game, he still delivered points ans assist, hali is the real deal men
Pacers Players and their coach are high class people, they really want to win this and are just good sport as shown on their interviews.

Meanwhile, most of their fanbase are sore losers, sad.
lol! let them be, its their coping mechanism...   
  


but if anybody here from the Pacers reading let me say, listen!! you could've been Detroit (zero wins during Nov) , but you have a whole bunch of talented young men! nothing to be ashamed.   
   

I follow the Lakers but i am also a huge fan of talented Haliburton, Hield, Turner, and my NY man, Obi Toppin...
What's funny when you read though it is how much they want to get rid of Hield and Turner. I thought the Pacers were better with Jackson and Mathurin on the floor.
That's from one of the mods too! Get u/Smart_Dumb some tissues.
[

&gt;My entire life has been the pacers losing to Lebron. Doesn’t matter what color jersey he is wearing. It’s the same result every time. I’m gonna be sick man.  


LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Man how fast did these hats sell out? Had one in my cart and I couldn’t even process the payment on fanatics. I’m sad lolI need them to restock the hats and offer the t thirts in fat guys sizes immediately.
Tonight was an awesome achievement and def deserves to be celebrated since we’re the first winner of this tournament, but I personally only buy championship gear.

I think making merch for this is a corny money grab.
Idk about the hats, but I was able to grab a couple of the shirts though.
29 other NBA teams don’t have one. Gotta be thankful and celebrate all forms of success! 🏆

PS: Clippers would have thrown a parade, LMFAO
Never like new era and their hats. I prefer 47 brand hats. Look better overall. Crazy people buy them but everyone got their preferences
Damn, ya'll actually buy this shit?

No wonder these players get paid $50 million per year, lol.

I can get these same T's printed on a Gildan for $4.
Don’t mind me, just telling everyone this was the real NBA finals 😬😬😬Do you think the Pacers would have been meme'd if they won?? 🤣🤣🤣Nuggets fans memories reset after 2023 lol
No, lots of pacers are the next big thing, their time is now posts. They defeated 76ers, Boston, Bucks then Lakers. Them being the first in season champs would be celebrated.
It would be funny if we didn’t literally also have the most NBA championships….its like when I hear people calling them “The Fakers.” Like….we’ve got 17 chips and been to the finals over 30 times lol….Fakers is actually the perfect nickname for the Clippers…
No, if the Pacers won this would have been celebrated league wide.

Once I saw “Mickey Mouse” trending I was like f the world lol.

This is far from a championship, but it’s cool to be the first to win the tournament.
I want that rematch so fucking bad
#Nobody knows what “Pacers Winning” looks like 😂
We the reigning champs now. League has to go through us.
Nuggets lost to the Pels. And look what we did to them.
man win or lose we'd get memed on so let's just enjoy it
Those Nugget assholes do have some pretty good memes ngl
Lmao
Lol all in good fun. 

The Nuggets ain't win this one tho. All I'm gonna say lmao

Reaves has really turned it on after his early season slump.
AD is a baaaaaad man.
Great Game 7 feeling for the Lakers!
Playoff Primer baby. AD had pretty much just one bad game I think in this mix.
AD was ALL DOMINANT in this game! ADPOY and ADMVP loadingCan’t expect him to do this every night, but it was a nice reminder to know that he still can perform at this level when there’s stakes.
It's ok that you missed out on the ist mvp AD get that fmvp you dawg
Honest to god it's unbelievable how much of a monster this guy is on defense, and then ALSO scorched the Pacers for 40+ points. 

Defense stats plus offense stats are like combining two separate elite players into one. Whew.
That brings up a good point about a game that doesn't statistically count.


It should showcase and boost his defensive player of the year cred.

 Every voter definitely saw it.
AD vs. Gobert for DPOY is like Ali-Frazier. Two absolute beasts duking it out.

Makes the Marcus Smart award look like a complete joke.
I‘M HIM
[LakersNation] LeBron James: “We want to put in perspective that we’re still in December, but we definitely like where we are (as a team) right now.”So surreal it hasn’t even been a full year with the New Look Lakers and they’re such a natural fit
Get Royce O'Neal on this team and it's game over for the rest of the league.

JHS + something for Royce and we are set.
We just need to get another servicable big and we look scary
I like the mentality coming from LeBron. This IST is basically a playoff simulation and this team got a taste of it.
Just like in 2020. That team wasn’t a great 3 point shooting team but punished teams inside. Played amazing defense and turned it on when it mattered.
The whole team be wearing black AF1s
AD is a young, healthy, alpha male
We just need to be league average in shooting. 

Not elite, just average. 

Something like JHS plus Gabe for either Bogdanovic, and we're absolutely ready to take a swing at Denver.
Defense looks like the best in the NBA. 3 pts shooting... well the defense has been great, really great.
The identity is clear. We're not the skill offense (5 out) team. We're a fuckin goon squad again lmao
One man bench mob! | Lakers Bench 30 pts 9/18 fg | AR 28p 9/15fg 10/12ft with a fluHIM.

One man bench mob brought itIs any other player in the league outperforming him off the bench?
4 Year / $54M well deserved for AR.
This is why you believe in the big sample size of last year's post all star run + playoffs + fiba instead of the small sample size of an early season slump.

Him always shows up for big games. Always.
He's so unbelievably good in big moments. 

I understand fans can be emotional, but I'm not sure I've ever been more disappointed in my fellow Laker brothers and sisters seeing how many people were condemning him at the beginning of the season.

This undrafted kid basically jump started our franchise from mediocrity to title contention when he became a star last Spring. 

And people were ready to ship him out of town after like 10 subpar games. An absolute joke.

We’re entering prime lebron right now
And people said his foot injury didn’t matter last year. Clown shit
4th Prime, 5th Prime, 6th Prime! Just keeps on getting younger and better !!
LeBron James and Anthony Davis react to winning NBA in-season tournamentThanks for posting
Is this what watching prime Shaq felt like?i was too young to experience Shaqs dominance and watching old games and highlights doesn’t give the same feeling as watching it live does. And yeah AD is HIM!Shaq would go through players, every time. Just carnage. It was either carnage or a 5 ft baby jump hook. It was like watching Sumo wrestling mixed with basketball.

AD at his peak is like Hakeem mixed with Duncan

Shaq was 1 of 1 , there’s never been anyone in the history of the game like him. Game wasn’t as physical in Wilt’s day; wasn’t as much force being exerted against Wilt, athletes weren’t so strong
Somewhat but not really. Prime Shaq felt like a battering ram hitting trees but he'd also be exploited on D
Taking nothing away from AD and the incredible game he had last night - Shaq just was on another level. It’s honestly hard to describe to someone who didn’t see it, I recommend watching an old full game or two. Shaq did what AD did tonight but with an extra defender (often more) on him at all times. And when the defenders were on him, he still was putting them in the basket and would be way more physical with them. Just a different level of intensity and physicality in the paint, ADs is much more finesse focused.
Prime Duncan or KG
Dude, watch this and understand the dominance of Shaq:

[

The guy who was helplessly trying to defend shaq was an NBA Defensive Player of the Year at one point.
Felt like watching prime KG tbh
No. Shaq had literal tall big bums employed just to get 6 fouls. Shit was a different level of insanity
No.  Shaq struck unholy terror on opposing teams.
As others have said, Shaq was an overwhelming force on offense, but not as dominant a defensive player as AD. These clips of him in the 2000 and 2001 Finals show him at his peak. In the 2001 Finals he matched up with Dikembe Mutombo, who was the Defensive Player of the Year.

[

[

[
Must be watching modern day bill russell. Except bill russell didnt have to go against guards in this era
Davis is a more dominant defender while 40-20 was something you could expect from peak Shaq. When they bought only Wilt and Baylor had those numbers that was due the 5 assists, but 40 points and 20 boards was a regular playoff home game for Shaq.
Imagine Lebron posting up TJ McConnell, how utterly hopeless it would feel for TJ. That’s how it felt watching Shaq post up most other players in the league.
My brother basically told me imagine this but constantly tripled team, then you basically have prime Shaq. Shaq is one of those NBA figures where he's talked about more like a myth than a player. Teams were literally just drafting bigs, whether they were good or not, just so they could throw a body at him.
AD played great tonight, but watching Shaq in his prime Laker years was insane. No one could stop him. The other team knew EXACTLY what he was going to do but couldn't do anything. Sometimes there were 4 defenders in the paint and they still couldn't do anything to stop him. I have never seen anything like it and I was also a kid, but I remember. For example, I know Giannis plays a different position, but we all know how dominate he is even against centers. But he could NOT do nothing against Shaq. Giannis would just bounce off of him EASILY. It's too bad he wasn't as serious about basketball as Jordan and Kobe, Shaq would be the consensus GOAT.
It's more like watching prime Hakeem.
Real talk, I only remember Shaq being dominant offensively and getting great blocks. I was too young to look at his overall defensive impact.

But, do you remember the le-Fuck you threes vs the Pelicans? You remember how that energized the team? Shaq did that with dunks on the regular.
Big Diesel meant a big ass mfkn truck you don’t want to cut off going downhill
Teams feared Shaq. Mostly they feared trying to defend him without getting postered, or injured. 

Teams hope that AD is having an off night, and is not as interested in playing defense. They don't fear AD until it's too late.
Not even close brotha. Lol. I agree watching Shaqs YouTube highlights will never give you the feeling that AD gave live tonight but Diesel was a different animal.  In a game like tonight where the Lakers were strictly paint focused, Superman would’ve feasted like a king. Turner wouldn’t have seen the second half. Lebron would’ve had 40 himself because of the lack of double teams and weak side help defense.(like Kobe used to take advantage of) To properly answer your question, No it didn’t feel like watching prime Shaq because we watched this game tonight with a level of uncertainty of what AD was gonna bring. With prime Shaq we watched with 100% confidence that he was going to dominate his matchup.
Shaq would of bodied AD and bullied him on and off the court
The game was so different in the 2000s. It was a slug fest every time. Terrible spacing. Lots of iso on the wing. But Shaq…every game was like a grueling boxing match and shaq was the undisputed heavyweight weight champ. Teams had to totally reconstruct their rosters to deal with him. They had to have 2 to 3 extra guys just taking up a roster spot to literally go in the game for a half dozen minutes each and foul him. He was the first superstar k remember watching. I was a little too young for Jordan but shaq got me into the game when I was a little kid.
Imagine LeBron-esque athleticism in a 7'1" body lol that's what watching Shaq was like.
No, it was totally different. Shaq was just so unbelievably overwhelming. Unlike anything you've ever seen physically.

But Shaq also didn't fly around like AD on the defensive end. Imagining Shaq try and defend high pick and roll and close to corner three point shooters is hilarious.
Shaq was more violent.
Naa bro. Shaq was dominating at his peak. He had triple teams hanging off his legs. I will give AD credit though, Shaq never played the defense AD has played.
Yeah kind of but Shaq put the fear in opposing teams more than AD. He was way more intimidating. Stat wise this was definitely a Shaq like game though.

Indiana Pacers vs Los Angeles Lakers | In-Season Tournament Finals Postgame Press ConferenceWonder how they respond though. Its only December and ad and lebron pretty much played at their peak performances. Not so worried about having a target on their back cause they always have a target even before this win but i cant see lebron playing the rest of the season with that much energy he just displayed. He was on a mission. Anything less will feel like a disappointment.
LeChessNotCheckers Smoking on that In Season Tournament NBA Cup MVP and NBA Cup Championship Pack LFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGI don’t really like Shannon’s takes anymore— his metaphors are always 🔥 tho
… And DLO got to hit back at Bruce Bowen Jr. (Buha: DLO gets Bowen in foul trouble and tells him to “Go Sit Down” 😮)“That’s two 👋🏼👋🏼”
I think Coach ham put Dlo in late in the 4th intentionally to inspire his confidence for down the road
Dlo also played well in 4th crunch time, when Pacers cut the lead down to just 3 (92-89), Dlo subs in and scores 4 straight points and an assist to AD to stretch the lead back.
Buha must be drunk. I hate that cheap shot artist Spur motherfucker. But this was Bruce Brown.
Bruce Bowen?
Let's laugh at the Larriors fans 🤣 🤣#Fuck Bay Area Sports! 😂
They forgot they had Chris Paul on the roster. He's been fighting his addiction for winning for years
The craziest thing is that CP3 got hurt right before the tournament was starting.
I forgot CP3 was still in the league
warriors fans better hope they win the play in at this rate
I now believe in prayer candlesLet’s go Lakers, the only team in NBA history to have won the In-Season Tournament championship!  Prayers answered!Props to coach Handy for his work on Cam's improvementHandy is one of the best assistants the lakers have ever had, but we gotta give Coach Ham his respect too.
Honestly don’t know if you can just give it your handy. Reddish has been so bad throughout his career that I doubt Handy even gave him a second look this offseason. Most likely gave his time to developing JHS, Max, and the other rookie I forget his name. Cam probably spent the entire offseason working on his game. Give him some damm respect.
It’s a combination of things. Ham keeping Reddish in games, LeBron publicly saying he’s going to keep passing Reddish the ball even after the missed game winner etc.
Props to Darvin and to Jent for wanting him so badly and giving him a platform to perform up to his level.
Just LeBron ThingsFinish your breakfast
Lol this was like when Chris Jericho (40 something at the time) won the first aew championship, this was his tag line for a few months.
LeBron James is the first player in NBA history to be both the youngest and oldest player to win MVP of the in-season tournament in the same season.
Next year he will be second youngest as well

Happy for AD. He looked great out there AND got the W. We back? When’s the parade?
40, 20, 5 and fouled out Turner, the guy Indiana wanted to go 1 on 1 with AD at the start of the game lol. That's dominating a game.

In all fairness AD was robbed.
Jordan doesn’t have one

Let AD have the finals MVP for the playoffs, I want bron to win his 5th ring
Youngest IST Mvp
Sweepstakes szn.. next is the Magic Johnson WCF MVP and then NBA Finals MVP
AD is only allowed to be a punching bag by fans/media.  It’s disgusting how little credit and accolades he gets for carrying this team doing everything Lebron could never do on defense.
FMVP LOADING
What are lebron and ad stats over the whole tournament? I can't find them
Baa baa baaaa
It's hard for him to win regular season MVP's and even championships due to age and injury concerns.

But what this proves to everyone is that he's still firmly in the conversation for Best In The World on a single game basis.

Which is insane for a guy in Year 21.
LETS FUCKING GO LAKERNATION!!!!!!!
MVP and FMVP soon
Why not Anthony Davis?
LeBron &amp; AD dominated the IST MVP VotingI like that the Indiana voter voted for Hali hahaha.
Manscape &gt; Andscape
If there were an IST Championship MVP, it’d easily be AD. Glad to see both our guys get their respect.
Lol Indianapolis star guy... I mean if you want to earn credibility speak/ report the truth🤷🏾
LeBron AD dominated the IST MVP Voting. Talk about a dynamic duo! Their on-court chemistry and exceptional skills were unmatched. It's no surprise they left their mark on the MVP race. Hats off to these incredible athletes! 🏀🔥
Lebron went craZ
Bill Simmons
Even Bill Simmons voted Bron
Dustin Dopirak wasn’t biased at all.
Boston, toronto not voting lebron lol
I love Jim with the Milwaukee Journal. Great Guy!
Yo if I remember correctly Gary washburn was the only reason lebron wasn’t the first unanimous mvp ever. He picked melo that year 😂
The guy who voted for Tyrese was from the Indianapolis Star lmao
BEST DUO IN THE LEAGUE WHEN THE GAME IS ON THE LINE!6 and a half minutes left but we all knew it was over after we saw AD’s face
I had zero doubts when I saw that look from AD. I just relaxed and enjoyed the show.
No doubt. The two-way ceiling of these guys is so much higher than Book and KD.
Locked in.
Do you have faith in Darvin Ham to coach this team to championship now?Yeah In-Season tournament is a completely different format than the real playoffs but it's good practice for the real thing. Gives Ham a chance to perform in high-stake matches and gain winning experience. Do you think Ham is capable of coaching this team to a real championship?I still believe that Ham has the makings of a good *Head Coach* but the coaching staff is still I need of some serious upgrading. He could really use a strong, experienced number 2, who can scheme up a great offense without trying to steal the job from him or sow discord in the team.

I keep saying this but Ham could really use his equivalent of Tex with Phil, or Hollins with Vogel. For all his flaws Ham brings one undeniable skill to the table, buy-in from his players.
Absolutely not. He's dreadful
OP, we could win the actual title this year and there will still be people here trying to discredit Ham.

They expect him to be a perfect coach to give him even an ounce of credit. No coach is perfect. Even Phil Jackson had his flaws.
He’s a player coach. Bron calls the X and Os
I think best case scenario from what I've seen of ham since last year is that he stays out of the way and let's the team cook... when he does too much it's usually bad
No... but hes been better last few games... at least he's not actively making it harder on the players. 

He's got to have them playing like this consistently &amp; against the denver, Philly, (fuck) boston, Milwaukee, or similar teams that are real contenders... 

It's great to beat the cute upstarts don't get me wrong but let's see what he can do against the contenders... so far it has not been pretty.
I think Ham got absolutely outcoached against the Nuggets last year, but he did a good job against the Warriors and Grizzlies, as well as kept the team believing after the horrible start last season. The team also had some great game plans during this season’s IST, like pounding the Pacers inside and doubling Booker and Halliburton. The Lakers are functioning as a cohesive unit in an aggressive defense, which doesn’t happen without a good coach.
He's getting there. His in game adjustments and timeouts are still suspect but he getting the team to play hard and seems to have figured a decent rotation now.
Ham is a good coach. We generate loads of open shots and generally have great game plans for other teams. Even tonight, hard hedging and switching on the Hailburton PnR was a great find for a weakness on Hailburtons game. Our offense just isn’t great sometimes because we miss open shots
He went to the wcf his rookie year, yes he can win a chip lol.
What we know and won’t change:

Ham is a likeable guy amongst the org and players and won’t be fired this year

Ham isn’t fit to be a nba coach rn

Lebron with his experience and Ball IQ allows him to basically be a player-coach esp when he’s on the floor. Hence the crazy +- disparity. When push comes to shove only thing Bron probs can’t/won’t do is bench guys and make rotations.
As long as Ham cuts out the weird ass lineups, which he has since everyone got healthy, then he’s capable.
Absolutely. Ham has been solid throughout this tournament. I don’t think people realize how hard of a task it is to coach guys like AD and Lebron. Those 2 guys have to buy in before everybody else can. When you coach them you gotta be able to take a backseat and not let your ego get in the way when they wave off a set that you call.
Yes


All these fans are just bias, if you really watch the game, the way he handles rotations, defensive schemes, most are from him which I believe he doesn't get credited for

While if the they get pummeled, even if sometimes it's the player's fault not committing to a system, it's always him who gets the blame 


I remember those fire Mike Brown chants before, look at him now
I’m a little angry he decided to play bron and AD the entire second half(bron got a 4min rest maybe) against a team we were controlling for most of the game. I understand he was hoping we pushed that 11pt lead to 20 but it left us pants down if the game stayed close. Crazy imo to experiment like that when you don’t have 7 games to go back to your normal gameplan if that would’ve failed.
I am in the locker room and I heard Darvin Ham's speech :
"Alright, alright... Here we go," [hands in pockets], "Firstly, I want to give thanks where thanks are due. To the entire team – you guys, man, you guys – you've shown such tenacity, such belief. 

We've been through the grind, through the ups and the downs, and look where we are now. We just won the first in-season tournament in the NBA! (small chuckle, hands still in pockets lol.) That’s no small feat.

I'm not one for big speeches, you know me. I like to keep it simple, keep it real. But today, today is different. Today, we’ve shown what we're capable of. We've shown the world that we're more than just a team. We're a family. 

As I stand here, my hands in my pockets, not because I'm detached or aloof, but because I'm comfortable. Comfortable with each and every one of you. Comfortable in the knowledge that we've got what it takes to make it. 

So, let's celebrate tonight, let's enjoy this. But remember, we've got a long season ahead. Let's take this energy, this victory, and let it fuel us for the challenges that lie ahead. 

Once again, thanks to everyone. To the fans, our families... this wouldn't be possible without you. Thank you and let's keep pushing, let's keep striving. Because we're not done, not by a long shot."

Hands still in pockets, a slow nod, a humble smile.

ps: Vando is the goat
I'm HAM!
I’ve been had faith when our record is way better than the previous 2 seasons
I don’t have faith in him winning us the big one but I also don’t think he would cost us the big one
Ham didn’t adjust to Pacers running the same moving high screen all 4th qtr…made the game closer then it should’ve been.
Sadly, I don’t. 

We have an extremely talented team imo, but our offense can get stale easily. We usually don’t have a great flow unless we can get in transition. 

We did great in the tournament, but I don’t trust Ham to find defensive solutions against elite offensive teams in a 7 games series. 

Also, he isn’t great in crunch time and his rotations aren’t great imo.
Hell no lmao
I mean he literally turned a meme (Cam) into gold. So .... I can take his flaws if that means he can make our role players good.
Thinking he has absolutely zero to do with this team’s ability to compete is corny as shit
No. He still doesn’t know how to call timeouts. And that challenge in the 2nd quarter was stupid
Ham is better than many in this sub think but worse than he needs to be.
No 😂😂, mf let Reaves cool down, left Christie during the Indy run in the 4th, and still runs zero play for Rui.
No. Lmao
I had faith in him at 2-10 last year. Guys play hard for him. He and his staff develop players into roles. He managed the Russ situation as well as he could. He takes a ton of shit from social media and keeps on doing his thing. He took this team to WCF last year and I hope he can take us farther this year.
No. I have faith in LeBron and AD. And props to coach Handy for his work with Reddish
Hell no
AD WAS AN MVP TONIGHT![gif](giphy|MO9ARnIhzxnxu)

Haters waiting for AD to "only" score 20 pts in a game so they can call him soft
Wow, AD really showed up tonight! He was an absolute beast on the court, dominating in every aspect of the game. It's like he had superpowers out there. Definitely MVP material. 💪🔥
Dodgers sign Ohtani. Lakers win IST. LeBron shines. AD dominates. Austin Reaves is HIM. I am invincible this weekend. Lol
If there were a finals MVP that had to go to Davis, but LeBron deserved the tournament MVP.

I'm proud of our guys. Reaves was great on the 3 elimination rounds and Dlo finally had a good game tonight.
It's extremely disappointing that the media will never give HIM his flowers. Thank God he doesn't care and lays it on the line every night. God Bless Anthony Marshon Davis Jr.
Charles Barkley has a striking resemblance to Pablo Escobar.
LOLHow to be salty 101
In an alternate timeline where Pacers won -

Post-Game Thread: PACERS ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD. GREATEST TEAM OF ALL TIME. THIS WAS HARDER THAN ANY NBA FINALS. REGGIE MILLER HAS BEEN AVENGED. YAYAYAYAYAYAYYYA.
The funny thing is, if they’d won, it would read “YOUR INDIANA PACERS ARE THE FIRST NBA CUP CHAMPIONS!!!!!!”
Salty much?
Lmao the salt is amazing
Another bubble ring
I like how you didn't link to that subreddit. Fuck em
Pacer fans really thought they had a chance at beating us LOL. If they knew anything about basketball they would've already known they'd have no chance with our healthy squad. Insufferable casuals...it's Indiana afterall. You think Brown went to Indiana because there's a good team over there? Lol no because Indiana paid him. Lebron owns Indiana. Bow down. East is garbaj teams, west is once again stacked. And we're on top of it.

Edit: they don't realize that the refs kept them close? How many free throws we talking about in the first half alone for them? Holy sh*t if it weren't for refs, it was a 50 ball. Worse than the Pelicans 🤣
Too much sodium
I hope we meet the Pacers in the finals. Such a fun team to watch
Pacers nevee felt out of thr game. Just couldn't keep up in thr championship round
500k for each player and how everyone actually tried says otherwise.  🤭 (I know they joking and I’m also joking lol)
Ha thats funny tbh. Props to them
Props to them for going 6-0 to get to this game.  Props to us for doing the same.  I like anyone who beats the Celtics.
&gt; if we have a halfway decent shooting night we win.

If you need a halfway decent shooting night to beat a team that hit 1 three…cmon. Especially when the refs were obsessed with you.

And why is it always “we shot bad” instead of “we got clamped”
They’re in there crying about the refs! Lol! The refs made you lose by 14 points and shoot like shit. A pathetic fan base.
Can someone check r/clippers and see if they acknowledge this tournament? Since they decided not to participate probably
Doesn’t speak for all of us. Some of us are grateful that we even made it this far and that the game was close. AD and Bron were just unstoppable tonight. Thanks for giving us a challenge.

I’ll be waiting for the IST Final rematch in the meantime, tho 😈
It's more funny when you look at that mods post history, and see how he posted the game they won against the bucks to advance to the final in all caps
Ngl it was a joke post. They were all talking about how they’d have loved to hang the banner and they have a free watch party that was sold out.
Hoes mad
I bet they were fuming in the game thread lol
Opposing fans will do their best to discredit every Lakers success. Pathetic.
Salty mfs if they had win the game they would be all over
Damn I coulda sworn Benedict Mathurin was flexing on us in the 4th quarter guess they took their foot off the gas bc they heard it was meaningless and nobody would respect this cup
cope
Salty-ass bitches. 😂😂🤣
It’s just a funny joke
Cry me a river Pacer fans
uhh.. did they see how sad Hali and Myles looked during the end of the game?
what are you all mad at them for this is funny
THEY MAD LMAO
I don't know what they're mad about, they ran through the entire east like tissue paper and are basically the hottest team in the league right now next to the Wolves, and we just handed them 60 minutes of film to fix their shit for the playoffs. 

Beating them makes the Lakers look real fuckin good
This is funny lol
That's actually funny lol.
Tyrese Haliburton absolutely wanted to win this game. It wasn’t meaningless for him at all.
Read some comments in there. Pacers fans really hate the lakers. I know we played them in the finals OVER two decades ago, but I had no idea they cared so deeply about us.


Besides the 2000 finals, am I missing something? Maybe combo of that plus lebron beating them plus PG asking for a trade to us?
That thread is pathetic, but the actual Pacers are worthy of respect.

They were outplayed all night, but never quit. 

Complete opposite of the Pelicans.
![gif](giphy|ECeqpz1PqAFzti4iIk|downsized)
LMFAO! The salt!!!!!!!
Hahaahhahahaahha
Poverty franchise won't win anything ever.

Lol Myles + Buddy great we did not do that trade.

Rob Pelinka masterclass
Don't worry. If Lakers lost, everybody would shit on LeBron because of another lost finals and it would be as important as championship.
They would throw a fucking parade if they won lmao
That’s pretty funny.
Love seeing salty haters
baAaAaAaAaaaAaaAaAaAaAaaaAaaAaAaAaAaaaAaaAaAaAaAaaaAah
🙄
jokes aside, huge respect to the Pacers team. they are still young but they were relentless and kept the game close. huge respect to them.

While being 62 years old. My GOAT 🐐
Downvotes to Adam silver for being a dick to the kids
How? Lol
[Sean Davis] The Pacers heard that nobody was going to “respect the IST Championship” and chose to shoot 37% from the floor and 24% from three tonighttook their foot off of the gas, $500k is basically nothing in this economy anyway

you're actually losing money if you win it because.... you get tired or something
[deleted]
Is Lou Will on that team
“Lemon Pepper” Lou Williams has entered the chat.
I got the reference
💉Copium
[StatMuse] Anthony Davis tonight: 40 points/20 rebounds/5 blocks. The only Lakers with a 40/20/5 game in franchise history: Elgin Baylor, and Wilt Chamberlain.it’s so stupid that this game doesn’t count toward the standings
That's a legacy building game right there.
First ever in IST history.
Anthony Marshon Davis
My goodness AD was a MENACE tonight
By far AD's best game of the season. Incredible performance. We literally have the GOAT and ADPOY on our team. I'm so happy being a Laker fan 💜💛
Insane Baylor had 13 of those games 🤯🤯🤯
Shaq like numbers 🥶
Doc saying over and over ‘it doesn’t count’ was so cringe.

We count it.
He was dominant tonight. 

Gotta be the only player in the league who could have 17-11 at the half and still get criticized by the halftime crew lol. The disrespect is stupid.
I’m surprised Shaquille never reached those numbers.

And talking about Shaquille, Anthony Davis certainly looked like him tonight at times.
I never want to hear about this stupid shit againYo they got their asses handed to them. Straight bully balled. Those 2. Especially
Two unprotected firsts?! LOL It would have been a fleecing.
No. But next time Dlo has a bad game we’ll get to hear about Zach Lavine instead.
Nah yall fucked up with that Russell Westbrook move
Arm chair GM's are constantly doing this. Left up to them the Lakers would have traded away all of our FRP's for the next 100 years for guys who wont be in the league in 5 years. These same guys do the same thing with the draft having the benefit of hindsight claiming they would have drafted someone different. They also dont have a clue how trading or the salary cap works and even after explaining it all to them they will ignore and keep posting the same nonsense. It is very frustrating to say the least.
I'm so fine with what we got. DLo and Vando are what we needed.
Caruso and Drummond for Gabe, Wood, and 2 seconds
And someone who never get why Laker fans were clamoring for that trade, I like to say that Cam's value wasn't high before he joined the Lakers. So, who knows how those two would improve playing with LeGreatness. Maybe they will suck or maybe they would be a lot better. We don't know either way.
Pacers are ass. Best team out the east my ass
Bu__y Hiel_
I was consistent on this. Never wanted that deal made. lol call em all out
I mean, we can talk about it. Would’ve been a significantly better trade than ending up with WB
I do want to hear about Tyrese!
Yup laker fans have no credibility like fucken 0 if this trade went down for 2 first rounds picks we would be fucked, but yea after every loss the geniuses come out on how they have the answer on how to fix the team but yall don’t just shut up and let this organization run the team cause they know more than u guys
I agree with this to an extent. Turner playing next to AD or off the bench would be nice. Same with Hield. But for 2 unprotected FRPs no. An actual fair trade or getting them as free agents would be great. Just don’t butcher our depth.
Don't worry, you'll hear about it after the next Lakers loss and they have one good game.
Myles Turner was said to be a plan for us to defend Jokic, this bum can't even avoid getting fouled out and dogged by AD lmao, oh sweet irony
McConnell stold the ball from AR and then scored back to back lay-ups on Reaves but the Lakers message board was, "Trade D'Lo".😂
Hear me out, they would have been better than Russell Westbrook
Still better than D’Lo
Turner was atrocious. I know not everyone can be AD and singlehandedly be an interior defense but they are legit buns at interior defense and you'd think if he was so good defensively he could at least make them okay.
I think it has been mentioned before buddy is completely useless if he doesn't make his shots cause he can't play defense. Can't remember what turners criticism was though. 

But this sub was upvoting hate towards pelinka for not doing the trade posts every few days or so.
They weren’t worth the lent in my pockets tonight. I still would’ve traded Russ and 2 FRP’s for them, but I’m glad that trade never came about because it brought back solid players.
😂🤣 facts foh
Nahhh...

I'd love to have them on the team (or would have loved to have them at many points over the years when it was rumored to be possible to acquire them).

**Can't judge them on just one random game** (despite the playoff feel and increased stakes).

They both have pretty good numbers and bring to the table exactly what you expect them to bring-- and exactly what the Lakers need.

-- The Lakers would covet a 17/8/2 (blocks) big who's 6'11" and sometimes shoots well from distance. 

-- The Lakers would also covet a phenomenal shooter (who could either start or come off the bench, based on matchups and recent performance quality)
To be fair Westbrick was so bad that anyone would’ve been better than him.  Props to Rob though for being patient waiting for the right deal while getting crucified up until the deadline
Did Buddy Heild play tonight?
![gif](giphy|UnUm4MxtAKIww)
Can you believe some fans here were begging to mortgage the future for these two
Combined 6/22 from the field, 3/14 from 3. 


They’re better than they played tonight, but tonight showed why a one trick pony like buddy isn’t valuable if shots aren’t falling. &amp; how fast and athletic we aim to play showed why turner isn’t an ideal fit.
These two were completely exposed.

I would not want them on my team during the playoffs if that is how they handle that kind of environment and pressure.
For two unprotected FRPs and the bad Russell. GTFOH.
turner cannot guard good centers lol. 2 firsts my ass
Bummy Hield and Myles "baby shit" Turner a combined -36. The Pacers have some ballers, Hali, Toppin, Nesmith, Nembhard etc...these two bums don't qualify.
Time to pick up that merch!Merch for this feels a bit “Clippery” to me. It’s like having a “Pacific Divison Champs” t-shirt.
Brought the tshirt
Collectors item. Congratulations.
Did the hats just sell out lol
LEBRON “y’all can’t guard me” JAMES: 24 Pts 11 Rebounds 4 Assists 2 Steals +19.Special mention to AD for being the defensive anchor and dropping 41 pts. Love u ADominant. I got flashbacks to 2020 bubble AD 🥲🥲🥲🥲. 

Cam Reddish for that 3 to break the drought and also for his constant excellent defense. 

Austin Reaves for getting to the line and making tough shots when our offense was cold during the first half to stop pacers eating at out lead.Those jersey are top 5 in lakers history
yoo!! Prince too
Only a foreplay for June of 2024.2023 Champions 🥹Anthony Davis. 1 of 1.God, I would've loved this game to be counted in the regular season stats; would've bumped his PPG up.

But this is a really good sign that AD can turn the fuck up when it matters.
He's HimClassic
WHAT A DAY TO BE AN LA SPORTS FAN 🤩🤩Reeves should be in that front row
At times like this I understand why they call us “trust fund babies” and I love it
Great..... As if I needed an Excuse to buy another Lakers Hat. Now I gotta get that Tournament Champs hat and they're all sold out. :-(
We won this so the Celtics can win NBA finals
They gotta switch vando and jhs in this pack, got him in the back with the rooks smh
This is the year
Awesome day! I will take a break on Tuesday- almost feel it will be a scheduled loss. With all the tiredness and that. I still hope we beat Mavericks but even if Lebron and AD get a break (there were some scary moments tonight) I think they earned them.
Am I the only/first person to notice that Max Lewis is in this poster twice? They tried to put Alex Fudge but didn’t even know what he looks like, and accidentally put Lewis twice with two different hairstyles 😂😂😂
Shoutout to my boy DLo! Lifted the LA up when they went on a short slump.
Congratulations to the greatest basketball franchise
Everyone did what they wass supposed to do but I still feel like prince is getting to many mins
This win kept me alive after losing Ohtani to the Dodgers.
Just heard, one of the assistant coaches just made 10 years of his salary because of the 500k.
Party like it's 2020!!!
Great day to be a Lakers fan. Tragic day to be a Giants fan.
Not gonna lie was thinking of following baseball with this Ohtani guy, now he signed with LA...
Hopefully this will give the Lakers a big momentum and steamroll everyone until June.
Fuck the dodger respectfully
cam so cute in this pic
This is not an insignificant accomplishment. You best believe I’m gonna count this as one of LeBron’s Lakers accomplishments!
LA Kings lost today but we're crazy good this season. 16-4-4.

This is shaping up to be a good year in LA sports.
Great day in LA sports!
Unless ur Angels fan 🫠 but still Lakers dubs and we couldn’t pay Shohei anyways!!
WHEN IS THE PARADE
i might call in sick. need to celebrate. lol
Well except for LAFC lol
I can just imagine Colin castleton popping a champagne bottle right now.
That's the 1st step, now off to chase banner 18!
#**SHO-TIME LAKERS**
Now the IST is over. I really hope the they'll continue the momentum the rest of the season and stay healthy
Fuck yessss
1st Champion for the In-SEASON Tournament 


AND OHTANI 

WHAT A DAY!!!!!
Ohtani and the IST trophy. Today is a good day
I‘M HIM
except lafc is a let down lol.
Flu Game Reaves about to make it rain in those Vegas Strip ClubsGlorious 🤣
ALWAYS READY
He looked distant during the awarding
Lmaoo
A picture is worth a thousand words 😂😂😂…so satisfying beating these two.Did anyone notice Tj hid his face behind that female trainer?
Fuck that Frog looking bastard I hate Bruce brown. He just looks like such a grimey shitter
McConnell is chill, but damn bro has to stop getting blocked lmao dude was getting cooked out there
We are lucky Brown chose the Pacers. Imagine being stuck with that 20m/yr contract for 11 ppg. Look at who we got instead. Love it.
So glad D’lo got the upper hand in this game on brown.. they were yapping all in the first quarter. “That’s two 👋🏼👋🏼”
McConnell dove into lebrons knee. Scariest thing I’ve ever seen. Dude slipped on air.
What’s the beef with TJ lmao
No Serbian is gonna save his ass now
The agony of defeat.
No one should have hate towards TJ McConnell
Ahh I was wondering where the Bruce brown roast post was
Nah TJ’s cool
Fuck Bruce Brown
Hats off to TJ. His tenacity kept the pacers in the game.
Talking all that shit during the off season
the AI algorithm at predicting the next sentence is like trying to win an Olympic gold medal in underwater basket weaving! 🏊🏀 Talk about a challenge! But hey, who needs predictability when you can have a rollercoaster ride of perplexity and burstiness? 🎢 Buckle up, folks, because this content is about to take you on a wild linguistic adventure! 🌪️ And did you know that the word karaoke comes from the Japanese words for empty and orchestra? 🎤 Now that's a fact that'll make you go, hmm, interesting! 😉
I can’t stand either of them. Brown got carried to a ring and TJ just circles around and doesn’t really do anything.
Fuck Bruce Brown
Jokic will not save Bruce Brown 😂😂😂😂
Dude I love TJ McConnell.
I know about Bruce Brown but what's the backstory when it comes to McConnell?
They couldn’t even stay on the court during the championship game 🤣🤣🤣
Dlo cooked this bum ass
IN SEASON TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS!!! SO PROUD OF THE TEAM!! And yes, DARVIN HAM TOO. Give the Coach his Respect!!Looks like a Vegas club flyer lol
Wood over Hayessss
Congrats to the champs! What a season! The team's hard work paid off. They're an inspiration to us all. Go celebrate and make some epic memories!

A taste of what’s coming soon! Let’s go!!
Hello angryshoper
ANTHONY DAVIS TONIGHT: 41 POINTS 20 REBOUNDS 6 ASSISTS 4 BLOCKS 64% FG DOMINANT. In season championsThe Brow of Death
This was an insane game

LVAD
Can’t wait for AD 12/3/1 next game lol.
AD went Ultra Instinct on the Pacers tonight.
Bubble Davis is probably the greatest player of all time.
He became a God.
Imagine making that face after blocking someone that is 1ft shorter than you.😭Let’s see if he keeps that same energy against Jokic in the playoffs.💯
He balled the TF out!!!
This AD is different I sometimes critique him but damn please prove me wrong AD
AD UNLEASHED HIS INNER MAMBA 🐍🐍🐍

The first ever In-Season Tournament Champions: Your Los Angeles Lakers[Wow, I can't believe it! The Los Angeles Lakers have made history as the first-ever in-season champions! 🏀🏆 This team is unstoppable, proving that hard work and dedication pay off. Let's celebrate this achievement together and cheer for the Lakers! Go purple and gold! 💜💛](
Lakers now officially greater than the Celtics 17 nba titles and now 1 in season tourney champion
FIRST.
EVER.

LAKERS OUTTA EVERYWHERE
CAM REDDISH LOCKED UP THE BEST PG IN THE NBA Cam Reddish didn’t have Black Air Force energy, he had that black Fila aura
How did we not pick fox he was the fastest player on the draft with the ball even before draft started
Underrated pickup for the lakers this season
All this cause lebron called timeout and didn’t have the ball
Smothered him , made the narrative seem like a push job. He good but is th that good ? We were taught to look at the numbers if u consistent that's u if u spike its just an outlier and has to be duplicated to be called ur new u
To be fair the lakers trapped him with two guards basically all game long. But now doubt Cam’s length and effort was a big part of why it was so effective.
Rajon Rondo?
Dont forget about vando too
Did Steph retire? Dafuq.
I’m loving our defense man 🔒
This dude just continues to surprise and impress. He’ll be vital to any run we’ll make. He’s a bigger Vando. A long as we score, we’ll go far.
Hit that late 3 as well to seal the game lmao, we ended up 2-13 from 3 and still won, insane
Steal of the off season
Cam stock is rising

![gif](giphy|f7GQKWSKo5ekWPUNnC)
It's crazy to think that at 20/11 with 3 TOV, we've already 'slowed him down'. Helluva player
I thought Vando’s minutes on him were key too. It must’ve been exhausting being hounded by two defenders like that, and then waiting on the inside was demon-form AD
Vando helped too
They were talking TF out of Haliburton before the game

End of the game people were like, “Oh, so that’s Haliburton”
DLo wasn't lying about Cam with his black air force energy. Locked up Hali and swatted tf out of McConnell's shot in the paint lmao
Haliburton served Dame Dolla the other day. The Laker defensive strategy collared Tyrese. Cam &amp; Vando, secret weapons.
Killa Cam lock up szn
What you guys think of Rui? Feels like they dont need him and doesnt fit.. no show again from him
How do they keep him next season???
The unsung hero of the game. He was a monster on D. Had Haliburton locked up. Also, team +24.
He definitely gonna get a big paycheck if he play like dis thru da playoffs… well deserved redemption, cultures matter to young players
Hali gonna be havin nightmares. Can't wait to see Cam giving Murray hell in a 7 game series.
This guy is key for a ring
ALL BLACK AF1 ENERGY
Playing Reddish at the 2 as a guard defender has revitalized his career. Would like to see if he can handle Murray/Fox
Shut him down!
Only took Rob a few years but man the 3 and D depth the Lakers have is so good.
I‘M HIMSingle handedly shook the Pacers
ABusiness is clearly HIIMMM
We witnessed Lakers history 💜💛AD dominated tonight but also: Elgin freaking Baylor, wow, I wish I got to see him play
Crazy Shaq never did that. Or Kareem.
I want no more disrespect in this man this season!!
Ahahah Elgin crazy good and ridiculously underrated
Make sure the AD praise as loud as the disrespect
The BIGGER the game, the more he shines!! AUSTIN REAVES was insane in the IN season Tournament. 28 points, 2 rebounds, 3 assists in the Final. BUCKET. AR FLU GAME.This is very true. He was a monster in the playoffs and today was just a show of it
Can't wait to watch him operate in the clutch of a Finals game.

He's literally born for thay

There's only one of these to win every year, once a couple more teams win this thing you'll see people start to really care about it. Like imagine if Boston wins it next season, it's really gonna start to matter. Only one team can be first tho.

Also the whole golden road thing of winning both in one season is gonna eventually be its own thing at some point.

And damn, the defense now that everyone is healthy is insane. Keeping the Pacers down to under 110 points it nutty compared to what they normally do, especially cause they probably cared a whole lot more about this game too.
im pretty sure that in a few years the IST will be worth almost as much as the championship…
all my Europeans know the worth of cups
They already making excuses to undermine
did you know that upvoting actually releases endorphins? It's like a happiness boost delivered straight to your screen! So join us in celebrating this epic win and let's keep the good vibes flowing! 🎉🥳🔥
This tournament is officially in the not count as a championship category because according to Lou Will the Clippers decided not to participate in it. 

/s
I don’t care if this is worth .01 championships, still one more than the Celtics
Huge day for LA sports. Lakers win the first ever in season tournament and the dodgers sign shohei ohtani!
I hope Silver cancels this tournament now, so we can be the one and only lmao
AD is the best player ever to play in artificials environments
YA'LL I'M SO READY FOR THE HATERS TO DISCREDIT THIS. WE DONT CARE WE CHAMPS BAAAAABBBYYYYYYY
Plenty of teams have won a championship.

No one else has won an NBA Cup.

Haters will hate, but this is special to me.
Back to back bubble champs!
It’s only right the greatest NBA franchise wins the first ever NBA cup 🐐

A lot of assumptions you're making there buddy. I just wanted to commend D Lo for making a couple of timely buckets.

Bet you got that novel queued for every time you see someone praise D Lo.
The things that Lebron is doing at this stage of his career is not normal and its a privilege being alive and witnessing the greatness. Its going to be really depressing watching the league once Lebron retires.
I love how awesome AD was hyped for this game. We need more of this AD. It reminded me of 2020 AD.
Monster game from AD as expected !
So you get a trophy just for playing games that you’re supposed to play in in the first place? Kobe didn’t die for this to happen.
Rui dont get any oppertunity at all its upsetting Ham must not fuck wot him or Wood.
Shouldn’t the lakers record by 15-9, or does the tournament finals win not count towards their season record?
For years the clippers kept boasting about regular season wins and people were calling them regular season champs but now that there’s an actual regular season trophy , they don’t got one 😭😭😭
Lakers champs and ohtani plays for my team, great day
I still feel like we’re wasting rui
Winning a game with that margin having 18 turnovers and hitting just two 3s shows you how elite this team is defensively when healthy and locked in.
This nba cup championship run was pretty amazing. Not gong to lie.  AD was a beast.
WE WIN BABY
Love us 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
If they win the Chip this year Lebron will have 6 titles
I’m from Indiana and attend IU (shoutout JHS) but I’ve always been a lakers fan. Brother when I tell you I’ve heard some CRAZY shit tn, let me tell ya man 😂😂😂
What's going on with Christian Wood recently? Why is he out from the rotation?
WE FINNA HANG A BANNER LFG
Love the Lakers 💜 💛 🖤
![gif](giphy|amF2NuFIi1doA)
And just like that Lakers have more trophies than the Celitcs
Wearing my AD jersey tomorrow with so much pride
So who gonna be the first ever team to win the DOUBLE in the NBA?
LAAAAAAAKERS BASKETBALL! FIRST EVER NBA CUP CHAMPIONS! AD WAS INCREDIBLE GOOGLE THE STATS! #LakeShow
Lakers- In season tournament world champions
What a fucking game. I miss this type of basketball. Clearly NBA players have become more skilled over the past couple decades and every game is a 3 point contest. It used to be exciting when there were only a couple teams that could score from deep at will. I find that type of basketball boring now because it isn't novel. What we saw tonight was good old fashioned basketball. I'd love to see this make a comeback.
I’m just wanna say that we dominated from start to finish despite some of the worst refereeing I’ve ever seen.
We don’t need to trade anyone! (Maybe Gabe)
Austin Reaves is literally James Worthy
We need an IST Championship Laker parade in Dowtown Los Angeles next week!!!!
![gif](giphy|xK5UpmynEfJI42NRfe|downsized)

When Adam silver comes home and his son didn’t take out the garbage cans
some rival fans are still mad and salty about refs "gifting us calls". They should either watch the game or look at the game stats page at least. [Pacers went to the line almost as much as we did, made 2 more than us. what they don't see is Pacers shot horribly from 3 point range. So did we but we did not chuck 3s like Pacers.](
We finally beat the curse of losing a game after a blowout win
Big City gonna need to pay a checked bag fee for his nuts on the flight back to LA that boy is cookin 🌃
Got the IST, now LBJ needs to get some days off.
Lakers win the first ever in season tournament and the dodgers pull off landing Ohtani, what an amazing day.
Lebron did something toninght that MJ never did, and that's leave Vegas with 500K more than he came in with
Give bron and ad the next game off please
Do we know why Rui didn’t play second half ?
That counts as a ring
INAUGURAL NBA CUP CHAMPIONS BABY!
1st EVER In-Season Tournament Champions for the purple and gold.

![gif](giphy|xT1XGPDVdqIWOX1DTG)
Have to wait 3 hours for the national broadcast replay to become available on NBA League Pass.
Give Ham and the Coaching staff credit. I know the lakers shots werent falling from 3, but the lack of 3's cut the pacers fast break offense, and leaks out of the Game.
YOU GUYS STILL WANT BUDDY HIELD AND MYLES TURNER? LMAO!!!
I know we don't count anything else but NBA Championships, but fuck it, we have more championship hardware than the cElTiCs. This is the same as a 1960s Celtics ring.
Big Fucking W. What a performance by AD.
Does this game count in the standings?
What freeways and streets we taking over in downtown tonight for this title win?? /s
Man that dub feels good as fuck
For the people who said this game doesn't mean nothing, then why are five Pacers in tears? Especially Haliburton.
Rui only played 8mins did he got injured or just looking bad atm?
I love how switchy the defense can be with the size &amp; athleticism at 2-3-4 and then you throw ADominant in there 🔥
Can people stop asking for trades? The team needs time to integrate and play well together, we don’t need another superstar only for the new iteration to fail.
I think the league should make two MVPs for the IST. One MVP for the overall tournament and then a Finals MVP. 

Being consistently great should be recognized, and Lebron deserves it for the first 5 games. But this is an all-or-nothing game, so showing out should be recognized as well. In this case, AD!
This team when healthy is incredible man
Worried about the adrenaline dump from winning a championship after entering playoff mode in season, but we shall see
AD was a monster. Reaves and Cam were so important tonight as well. Elite team defense!

Terrible game to watch though. Refs were calling the softest calls on both sides. It was ridiculous. We couldn't hit a jump shot to save our lives. Thank god for the terrible Pacers defense. 

And I am sorry, but this game has put the nail in the coffin for me. DLo gotta go at some point this season. He just chronically underperforms in pressure situations. 

His 3p shooting is streaky as fuck as soon as the lights are bright. He also takes too long to get into set plays with his herky-jerky slow style of play. He is great for the regular season, but I just CANNOT trust him once the playoffs start. 

Good dude, seems like a great locker room guy, but I just don't see us being a genuine contender with him as our starting pg.
Dlo should share 50% of his salary to reaves.

He's a bum 🤦🏻‍♂️
💜💛
so do we agree that Darvin Ham is a good coach?
Got other fanbases heated we really back
Where do you find some dumb championship gear? I wanna rock an IST champion jacket like a fucking nerd.
Ohtani is a Dodger

Lakers are IST champions

Today was a good day

![gif](giphy|op2Br9pDuAIQo)
We out here dominating in the paint, we don’t need 3s to win (in season) championships
I said it earlier today and I’ll say it again. LAKERS MF NATION
I don’t think our final point differential will ever be beaten over a 7 game series.
All my Tree-hugging friends say fuck Haliburton! /s
AD is so good man
We dont need to shoot threes when we have Anthony Motherfucking Davis playing like this GET THE BIG FELLA THE BALL AND GTFO THE WAY!
well, there's that first 'lakers good opponent' win that everyone was whining about not happening  


rested, mostly healthy  


shit on those kids  


MVP pushing hali held to 20/11, very good offensive indi played good defense on  


only thing people can complain about is DLO, shot like ass in a 'big game' as per usual
not sure if you guys know this but the NBA finals are in June
It’s great to the first in season tournament champ
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOO
Thats one IST Chip and IST FMVP for Lebron JorGambler could never
lakers and dodgers dual parade when, lakers for IST and dodgers for signing shohei
Shout out to CoacHam
Good to give it back to Bruce
First im season tournament champs🏆!!! This team gonna be scary come playoff time with even more experience.
Scary part is Rui or Vando didn’t score
Give Lebron and AD two weeks off, I don't care about the record we will make the playoffs.
I don't care about anyone else. Give AD a week of rest. Idgaf send him to the Bahamas.

We want more

"The Lakers are now 12-2 in games this season where they have fewer than 4 rotation players missing due to injury and also aren't on the second night of a back to back" (via @Tim_NBA on Twitter)If we stay relatively healthy we can gun for the 1 seed
Live look at the Lakers celebrationbrons lunch money
Anthony Marshon Davis Jr. in the NBA In-Season Tournament Championship Win: 41 POINTS, 20 REBOUNDS, 5 ASSISTS, and 4 BLOCKS.That’s his middle name? Didn’t know that lol
all-time leading scorer in IST final history!
ANTHONY MF DAVIS. 41 POINTS, 20 REBOUNDS, 5 ASSISTS, 4 BLOCKS. DPOY, MVP - GIVE THAT MAN HIS PROPS. WAS EVERYWHERE ON DEFENSE AND OFFENSE. LAKERS WIN THE FIRST EVER IN SEASON TOURNAMENT!! LET'S GO!!He looks like Kobe there with the intense scowl. Love it!
Hello angryshoper
Can anyone tell me does stats for this game included into career stat? Its a shame tho if it's not
![gif](giphy|sa6TjxRMvmgYtuIylU)
ADPOY GOATED
HANG THE BANNER. WE'RE WORLD CHAMPSLakers secure the NBA Cup title! Another championship to hang up at Crypto arena. This is a win and title that should be celebrated and acknowledged considering the Lakers were able to turn around the WB eraThey can hang that thing in El Segundo at the UCLA heath center. The Lakers aren't about small time stuff, I mean heck they don't even retire numbers of incredibly important players for the franchise if they aren't Hall of Fame players (we see you Fish, Scott, Horry, Cooper, etc).

It's a nice thing to have, at most they should make a tiny jersey patch for it and use that whenever they wear their city kit.
We don’t hang banners for anything less than a Finals win, we aren’t the Clippers.
I read a article that Jeanie used the western conference final trophy as her doorstop
[Gasol] Talk to them AD!!! @lakers #InSeasonTournament🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
They need to bring Pau in and work with AD on some of those quick hooks he's used to kill people with🤔
The Hermano! 💜💛 Laker forever
I always wondered, if it feels a bit different playing PF for Lakers


We got the GOAT C, the GOAT PG, the GOAT SF now (over Bird surely). Can't blame Kobe for being 2nd GOAT behind MJ. 


But we don't have a contender for GOAT PF.
You absolutely love to see it. Today has been great.
Two of the best PFs in LAKER HISTORY
Pau keeping it 💯!
&lt;3 Gasol
That’s a bad man 〰️This is the best moment in the game for me
All in favor of this being the default AD picture for every post about AD?
He's like dat
Mfs gon learn to stop disrespecting him
Too bad none of these stats count towards the regular season
Thanks for posting this
Most important thing to take away from this gameWe don't win without any one of our core rotation players playing the way they did. It's been so much fun to watch everyone play their role effectively. We had moments from players that made no sense, but overall it felt like we saw a proper TEAM and not just LeBron or AD carrying the whole time. If we keep this up, we could take any team in the league.For sure. And he was on the floor late in the 4th
I can’t believe people wanted to trade DLo.

He’s exactly the kind of PG this team needs. The way he was able to make pocket passes and find guys was big for the lakers.
Rui and Hayes seem to be the most replaceable rotation players. &amp; wood, but he doesn’t seem to be in the rotation. 


Our identity just doesn’t mesh with ruis skillset, and Hayes is still just too raw. 


Having 8 solid rotation players, 9 with Vincent, that can play this balls to the wall style of team defense blitzing and recovering looks a whole lot like our 2020 playoff run.
[Haynes] There’s champagne and goggles awaiting the Los Angeles Lakers in the designated celebration room.What they get for max christie some Pepsi
