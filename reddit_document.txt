My perception of popularity in the city is:

Is that right? Maybe Rams higher because football is #1 overall?

Post Title:Lakers #1 defense since the return of Vando
Post Body:
Comment:This is a question for Lakers fam, do we even need Caruso? Like does adding Caruso help our team defense when it is already elite with Vando back? Do we need other things like another defensive big or playmaker?
Comment:May sound abit harsh but honestly cutting c wood out of the rotation has helped alot also. Sticking primarily to our switch able wings makes us an elite team (with Hayes to spell very short AD rests)
Comment:Fun stat, but definitely not because of Vando. He really hasn't played that much yet. 

I'd argue that Lebron actually defending for more than the 4th quarter has made a huge difference. It allows AD to help in other places. Cam's return has also helped a ton.
Comment:Vando is that MF
Comment:Vangoat
Comment:Sorry Hali but it‚Äôs time for you to go to Vando vault
Comment:By a wide margin too
Comment:His rebounding is a big reason why. Someone who denies dribble penetration and boxes out is exactly what this defense needed. Its really helped our offense too. It isn't all on him, but it certainly helps.
Comment:It also seems (though I haven't looked at the numbers to back it up) that the Lakers are giving up far fewer offensive rebounds while also getting more per game the last week or so.
Comment:95.4 is insane
Comment:Not valid data, the sample size is too small.

Once Vando gets back to his top shape we are going to be a lot better than those numbers are showing:-)
Comment:God I wish vsndo could do shit on offence . I don‚Äôt know why Rob extends him to make him untradable without proof of offence . I love vando too but we need a legit two way wing not flaws players ge offers everything we need but screen navigation n shooting . Doubt he‚Äôd even an Aaron Gordon lvl shooter atm or this year /or westbrick kess bad years at 32%+ on 3-4 attempts
Comment:Just wait until ~~Ariza~~ Vando is ba‚Ä¶. Oh wait it actually happened and is legit
Comment:This is what this team was built for. Defense can always be there while shooting comes and goes. Imagine AC in this line up...
Comment:And ham still only plays him 10 min
Comment:Gotta keep it up
Comment:dayum, by a really nice margin too
Comment:Against good teams too
Comment:Vando/Cam with AD, not to mention D‚ÄôLo‚Äôs newfound hustle. I love what I‚Äôm seeing and I think we can make good defense our identity
Comment:Vando comes back and the Lakers have their best rebounding game of the season against the Suns.

Comment:[Vando's Vault](
Comment:Im sure its not all on him cause he‚Äôs played limited minutes. Imo our defense as a whole really stepped up when reddish was plugged into the starting lineup.

Post Title:The Pacers are a great team to meet in the IST finals
Post Body:Honestly, any other Western conference team in the finals of the IST would probably have me rooting for Indiana. It's impossible to not root for Tyrese Haliburton, plays the game the right way, seems like a genuinely good guy. I loved watching him and AR carry that USA team during FIBA game after game, and it's gotta be great for him, coming full circle to playing a high stakes game like this against his favorite player of all time in LeBron.

Plus the Pacers are just fun to watch. They are fast, explosive, run the floor, and look like they're having a blast while doing it. I think this game is gonna be really intense.

I still give us the edge, we have the perimeter defenders to disrupt their offense, and their defense is basically swiss cheese, especially in the paint, but I'm looking forward to a really fun and competitive game against a team that is probably one elite wing and maybe some defensive depth away from being a title contender. Let's get this W!
Comment:Just got a last minute flight to Vegas. Let‚Äôs fucking go!!!!
Comment:Kobe‚Äôs first championship was against the Pacers. Just saying‚Ä¶
Comment:Pacers fan here just lurking. Appreciate the love and respect for our team! I should hate LeBron for all the heartache but I can‚Äôt hate the dude. Good luck tonight and I hope we have a great game to watch!

I hope LeBron gets as many rings as MJ but just not against the Pacers
Comment:Lol tyrese got some weird shooting action n how the hell it goes in still baffles me
Comment:Fuck them i want to win by 50 and i hope Halliburton has a horrible game
Comment:I was watching the replay of the last game and listening to the nba tv feed and they mentioned pacers had like 10 guys that were making $3 mil or less. I started to feel bad and thought man it would be a nice gesture if lakers just gave them the win since it means nothing to the standing and would help alot of those guys. I looked it up and pacers actually inly have 7 ACTIVE players that make 3 mil or less. Lakers actually have 8 ACTIVE players that make 3 mil or less so now I don‚Äôt feel so had if we do win. üò≠
Comment:This will be a bigger test for Ham tonight. Carlisle is a lot like Spo where they'll make adjustments mid game and take advantage of mismatches. Ham biggest weakness is adjustments (calling timeouts too). Hopefully he's preparing team well for this matchup. It won't be easy tonight. We'll definitely see some zone as well and that really tricked up the Bucks. It won't be easy neither should it be.
Comment:Indiana is a good young team, now let‚Äôs beat their ass and send them packing
Comment:‚ÄúPlays the game the right way‚Äù not you too üòÇ
Comment:Same. The Pacers are my second favorite team to watch. I root for them against everyone except the Lakers.
Comment:Probably the hardest road this tournament! Pacers are definitely a fun and challenging team to watch. We should get the dub, but they do have a very high efficient 3 point %, with Buddy Hield and Hali
Comment:Lakers in 1!!!
Comment:They are great. Young, energetic and likable. They have a bright future. Rooting for Turner and Hali.
Comment:I want to see Reddish and Vando sic the Doberman on Halliburton.

Comment:A game that doesn‚Äôt matter in the standings with my favorite team going against my favorite young player‚Ä¶shit‚Äôs sweet ü•≤

Comment:Man they have been a phenomenal team to watch these knockout rounds. Faced the toughest opposition in their conference. With that being said I wish them the best of luck because this is MF Lakers Nation
Comment:Yeah they‚Äôre a great team playing great basketball. It won‚Äôt be easy tonight
Comment:A big W for this IST is that we get a chance to see a high stakes game between 2 good teams and see what either of them are lacking and are exceling at.

LeGreed will want that 500k so its a Lakers W.
Comment:Yes, Pacers are an exciting team to watch for the first time in a generation.

Between Turner and Haliburton, and all the supporting cast, they are very fun to watch.

Dame making threes from half court in the 3rd shook them for a bit, but they got their groove back took over late.  Very good win against Milwaukee.
Comment:If we can get a few turnovers and get them in foul trouble it will only be a matter of us making our shots.
Comment:I'm a big fan of Hali, he is a talented likeable young player that plays the game the right way. That said, fuck Indiana, Lakers by 20, I want to see Fino closing the game while LeBron gets ready to receive the MVP trophy üèÜ
Comment:I saw the Turner interview clip about his lego's on /r/nba and it instantly make me like the guy lmao
Comment:Hali is just a super likable and charismatic guy, on top of the fact hes becoming one of the best legit PGs of this era. It's hard to not root for the guy
Comment:Hopefully the role players can continue to hit their shots
Comment:He‚Äôs a lot of fun, and you get the bonus of having Kings fans slowly realizing they traded a superstar who wanted to be in Sac for a cute story beam team.
Comment:I am very curious to see if they can force Haliburton to commit some turnovers. I have a ton of respect for him.
Comment:For real. They're really good. LeBron and AD gotta put out their light tho. Gotta cut out that hope
Comment:Either we‚Äôre gonna get blown out or they will. Haliburton hasn‚Äôt gotten the Steph curry treatment yet.
Comment:Was rooting for them against Boston and the bucks. There are tought to beat with those 3 from everywhere and they attack the rim. 
Need an awesome AD to punish them !

Comment:Does this game not count towards our reg szn record?

Noticeably less agile though, his change of direction and sideways movement is much smoother here
Comment:How old was Haliburton when this game was played? Was he even allowed to stay up late to watch it? Was the game played on a school night? Sorry, just conditioning yall for all the age disparity takes they‚Äôll be doing on the pregame shows.

What's crazy is that some of these gentlemen, get paid millions of dollars and still don't commit to their regime, and this isn't fiction, this is fact.

Comment:The only reason people accept that Lebron is human is because he's had injuries. If he was injury free his entire career like never missed one game, he'd be seen as a deity.
Comment:The fastest team with the best offense. The stars have to score and dominate if we want to keep up. Can‚Äôt be going on scoring droughts and letting the pacers get the ball and run. They‚Äôll run us right out of the gym into a blow out like what happened to the bucks
Comment:The first IST is probably the most important one. It‚Äôs not a championship but I feel like having the Lakers franchise be the first winner is a nice feather in the cap
Comment:LeThanos has always been the final boss for the Pacers since the PG days. He is inevitable.
Comment:All I want is Ham to start Vando and put him on Hali
Comment:Don't underestimate the Pacers. They are a good team and are now here to face us for a reason.

They beat Tatum and The Celtics, They beat Giannis-Dame and The Bucks. And they are not afraid to face Lebron and AD.

We underestimate The Nuggets last Playoffs and keep saying Lakers in 6 or 7 but turns out we are the underdogs.

Lakers have to play hard tonight for this and bring home the Trophy.
Comment:![gif](giphy|0Js3uClIwJriEbP3Lx|downsized)
Comment:I think that the IST MVP award is going to be called "The LeBron James award". 

  
Silver already said that he is sure an award is going to be named after LeBron one day. LeBron is probably the only superstar that balled out like crazy during the IST. I may be wrong but I'm sure the Lakers and LeBron taking the tournament very seriously contributed to some extent to  the commercial success of the IST.   
And we know LeBron wants his franchise in Vegas. He'll probably never play for his franchise so the only thing he can do is ball out in front of them.   
All the elements are here to see a legendary LeBron James performence. 

Might be some 2018 Cavs type of game tonight.
Comment:Dlo revenge game incoming?

Comment:Wild how today doesn't go against our record, guess it could be a good or bad thing.
Comment:Damn, the Raptors sub is going in on Dennis right now. He's playing pretty badly now since the dream start apparently. 

I love him as a player but I think 6th man really is his best position. He limits your team as a starter unless it's a very carefully crafted team.

If we keep Davis fed Turner isn't stopping him and nobody is stopping LeBron, nobody.

Reaves once again has being our 3rd best player in the IST elimination games. I trust Austin because he raises to the occasion usually stepping up in big games.

This team is better and younger than last seasons team, I'd bet are bringing that home. Except by Ham and Dlo we are better everywhere, but we have LeCoach available.

The blueprint and keys are all out there, hopefully lakers can see it. Nuggets arent invincible, not even on the level of KD GSW. Theyre truly beatable imo. Other than Jok, they dont have another big that can guard the paint and their bench is shit.

I get it we weren't healthy in the beginning of the season and Lebron was injured during the playoffs but do you think we have a good chance against them now?
Comment:I live in Colorado now from South Central La they think the Chicken Nuggets greatest team ever.
Comment:We were 2-2 cs them last regular season , with one loss no ad or Bron , other 3 games never both .
Comment:They can. Just need Lebron healthy lol. 

Earlier this season first game, Ham purposely played Lebron less than 30 mins. Took him out when the Lakers cut it to 3.
Comment:Because our shooters forget how to shoot and they got kcp to lock up
Comment:In the WCF the Nuggets shot abnormally good, and we shot abnormally bad. If we both shot the norms there is a chance we would have won and we have a better team now. that being said, we dont play Rui or D LO in our closing line up, we need to make a trade for a bog wing that can hit 3s and play def.
Comment:Dog do you not watch the NBA?  Any team can beat any team on any given night.  Last year we beat the Nuggets twice even before the trades.
Comment:The answer and X-factor:  AD
Comment:0-6 is a nothing burger stat. 

- we played then 4 times in the playoffs last year 

- we played them 4 times in the regular season last year 

- we played them once this year

One of the loses is from this year, and four of them are from the playoffs. 

Furthermore, this year's Lakers team &amp; this year's Nuggets team are different teams from the ones that played past year. 

We have only lost to them once this year, and it was on opening night. Let's see what happens next time we play them
Comment:Give the rockets some credit, sengun has studied jokic like on an autistic level
Comment:Our fan base don't want to fix the issues we had against them last season.

Fortunately they lost the backup that was running circles around our starting PG, now they only have Murray and KCP to abuse Dlo, but we have Reddish to take care of one of them.

I agree with the other poster about the lack of a defensive center we could use on Jokic like we used Dwight in 2020 when Davis already had a tough time dealing with him and protecting the paint from other players.

I hate watching repeating errors, it worked great in 2020 while we struggled last playoffs.

Dlo against the Suns and Pelicans averaged 3 assists and 2 rebounds, the exact same numbers of the Denver series improving to 11 ppg from the 6 ppg he averaged last playoffs. It seems like most fans don't think it is a problem, I do.
Comment:We have historically smacked the shit out of the nuggets even in the dark Westbrook era. They swept us in the conference finals because AD and lebron sold their souls to beat the warriors and we‚Äôre both clearly very unhealthy and we just never win on opening night. They are a good team but not nearly as strong as people like to think.
Comment:Doesn't help that mickey malone hypnotized them to see red whenever they see purple and gold. I feel like they shoot like 75% against us and shoot normal when its any other team.
Comment:Okay here's my shot- turn Jokic into a scorer over AD all game long. Stay home on everyone, don't help when Jokic is in the game. Make him score over AD for an entire series. He is one of like 3 guys who can do it, but it won't be easy. 

Our roster now has insane length and athleticism on the perimeter compared to last year. We are going from Dennis, Troy Brown, and Lonnie to Prince, Cam, and Max. We are just way bigger and rangier than we were last season. It's much harder to shoot over the top against us now. So when they go to Murray/Jokic pick and rolls, just stay home. Make Murray to take shots over our lengthy defenders, AD and LeBron crash the glass and try to keep Jokic/Gordon off the O glass. 

Biggest problem imo is still rebounding. I don't want AD going for an offensive board like ever lol because teams love getting into transition when he does.

Idk. Still a tough series.
Comment:Lebron was hurt, our team was newly formed and we had no one to contain Murray in the playoffs last year. 

Denver was playing incredible basketball, and the team simply overwhelmed us. 

Now we have a bigger, younger, deeper team, and Denver has lost a couple of players. I watched their game against the clippers. Joker was lethargic, Murray was gimpy, Gordon couldn't sustain his energy and the depth is younger and can't be relied on the way they could with Brown and Green. 

If Bron and AD are healthy, I think we will do much better in a series with those guys. I think Utilizing Hayes and Wood to foul, and run the floor v Joker will help to wear him down. 

I'm not saying we match up great, I'm saying we have a much better shot.
Comment:Nuggets didn‚Äôt get up for those games, Nuggets come to play against us, they don‚Äôt care about the Clippers, Rockets or Pelicans
Comment:Side note but man that kyrie injury doesn‚Äôt look good
Comment:Lakers can beat them. Lebron just needs to be healthy.
Comment:Lack of time to properly integrate the team, bron being forced to return early, AD hobbled as well. And still we reached the wcf while embarrassing the warriors on the way. All games albeit a sweep were all massive close. So yes i do believe we can beat the nuggets as long as we are healthy
Comment:Jokic is the biggest player on the floor in our matchups. Being smaller causes problems. Though on opening night we arguably only lost because Lebron was on that stupid minutes restriction.
Comment:AD really needs to step up. That simple
Comment:Y'all act like it's a Clippers-like streak. The Lakers can beat the Nuggets.
Comment:Play like we played against the Pelicans.  aggressive every play.
Comment:LFR recently talked about why teams that initiate their offense from their bigs are not a good matchup for LAL. 

He said it‚Äôs b/c the current team doesn‚Äôt have the personnel to make life hard for big men like Embiid, Jokic, Sabonis and Bam compared to the 2020 roster that had Javale and Dwight who allowed AD to roam off ball as a helper 

With the current roster, when they face these types of bigs it makes AD have to be the primary defender and that really negates how good this team can defensively when AD can‚Äôt be a helpman on defense. 

When teams have guards or wings that initiate the offense, this LAK roster can easily slow those guys down with the plethora of athletic rangy wings on the roster but there‚Äôs just not a plethora of burly bigs on this roster how 2020 did 

Let me say it like this to make it simple: if this current team swapped Wood and Hayes for say I.Hartenstein and Gafford then AD could go back to a helper on D @ PF alongside both these guys vs DEN 

In fact, this is a huge reason I‚Äôve wanted to get a passable burly big on the team. Give the team the option to go big vs DEN with Bron @ SF on MPJ, said burly big on Jokic and AD on A.Gordon who‚Äôs a shit shooter. AD would be able to roam off of AG on defense
Comment:The Lakers narrowly lost each game with Beasley, Troy, Dlo, Lonnie and Vanderbilt all becoming unplayable in that series. Adding two-way players in Prince, Reddish &amp; Vincent addresses that prior weakness. I still feel like Wood‚Äôs role should be to allow AD to focus on defense with less pressure to produce offensively and Hayes so far has been pretty decent as his backup whereas last year there was no backup C. LeBron didn‚Äôt have his 3pt shot at all in that series due to injury and is shooting better than ever now. 

Blah blah blah my point is this current Lakers team would‚Äôve won the WCF last year.
Comment:We can beat them. It's beyond obvious now that LeBron was severely hobbled during the playoffs, and we still fought them close in every game. I think we probably win that series with this season's LeBron.

To reiterate: We CAN beat the Nuggets
Comment:Step 1 Be fully healthy.   And then, we need AD to be the best player on the floor
Comment:Jamal Murray, particularly playoff Murray is extremely good. 

We don‚Äôt have a lockdown guard.

Post Body:Moral of the story is we have made it through a very condensed portion of the schedule while dealing with tons of injuries as the 4th seed in a stacked conference.

Thats pretty neat. 

Funnily enough, after the IST game on Saturday, we have a Tuesday/Wednesday back to back. So we‚Äôll have played 26 games by Wednesday which will surely be 2 more than any other team.
Comment:The thing is the championship game today doesn‚Äôt count towards the regular season standings or any of the players statistics soooo realistically we‚Äôre only going to be at 25 after Wednesday but by most accounts we will have played 83 games.  Same number as the pacers.  No other team will have played that many games in a regular season
Comment:Thanks for bringing this up. It‚Äôs bull shit that our schedule is cooked because everyone wants to see us play. This means our games matter more and will affect standings seeding etc. that all star break is gonna be critical

Comment:At this rate we'll play 98 games by the time we win the championship this year
Comment:We've got a mf squad.

I'd just love to see Gabe coming back and us being less dependent on LBJ. I want him to lecoast a little and the team finding an identity without him on the floor too. I don't know of you realised but even yday he left at +12, came back in at +2 to bring us back up to +10, then the game went as it went.

I want us to be able to defend a lead without him so that coach Ham can give him some extra minutes to relax. We need Pels IST game LBJ throughout the PO.
Comment:Do we get an extended break at some point in the schedule?
Comment:And they gonna play 1 extra game.
Comment:It's actually a favor for us. We get to be more rested before the playoffs.
Comment:To be fair thats partially because we made it to the finals of the in season tournament
Comment:We have Three B2B games in December and two 3 games in 4 days. When does the schedule actually thin out?
Comment:And 18 of those games were against .500 or better teams. It's been a tough stretch. The Lakers record is quite good considering that and all the injuries they had.
Comment:Yup. We‚Äôve been overworked on this schedule. 

But hopefully it cools down. Could‚Äôve sworn I saw in Jan that it settles down
Comment:Exactly. I feel really, really good about where the Lakers are right now.

Why would Indiana do that?

Because many Lakers fans insist Dlo is a starting caliber PG for a championship contender and led us to the WCF last season, something Haliburton was never able to do.

I love the arguments of our fan base :-)

Lakers win, LeBron James healthy and motivated is just too much for Indiana IMHO. While I like Turner, Davis is just &gt;&gt;&gt;, Reaves usually plays well when it matters and we have Vando and Reddish to make life miserable for them when we are committed to get stops.

Indiana advantages are coaching and PG.

Post Title:Realist trade with huge upside
Post Body:I was about how we can really make a splash in the trade market and came up with something I feel like could make us contenders. 
Instead of looking to trade for another point guard or play Maker I believe the best way to upgrade would be to help Anthony Davis and Lebron. 
Trading Rui a first round pick and maybe a second or two for pascal siakam or OG seems to me to be ideal. Especially against Denver. 
Trading dlo just seems so counterintuitive, especially when we‚Äôve been looking for someone to make consistent 3‚Äôs and that‚Äôs what dlo offers. 
Our starting lineup could look Iike dlo,vando,lebron, siakam/OG, AD. Which would be a defensive animal against teams with super star bigs.
Comment:Delete this.
Comment:No trade matters unless it helps solve slowing down Jokic. Need another big or two who can play the 5 a La Dwight and Javale a few years ago.
Comment:Not a realistic trade. Toronto would never do it
Comment:We don‚Äôt need a trade right now. Maybe a player of two become available later once the dust has settled
Comment:How the fuck aren't we contenders now!???
Comment:I don‚Äôt know who it would be or who is available but the trade that would put the lakers over is for a big that will get 10 boards a game and just play hard physical defense.
Comment:Said it before but Jerami Grant is probably the best fit and most realistic target.  Making $27M so a Rui, Gabe or a Rui, Prince, JHS salary matches works and Portland probably won‚Äôt ask for too much.  Good defense and adds a scoring punch.

But honestly why are we talking about trades when we‚Äôre finally getting healthy and finding our team?  Most of these trades can‚Äôt even happen until January 15th
Comment:Yes someone that can shoot the 3 ball consistently. Hopefully he tells Toronto he‚Äôs not resigning in free agency so we can send rui and 1st and then have a legit 3nD starter. Some of ya wanna keep the same team but we‚Äôre dead last in 3pt% with the fake 3nD guys we got on our team.
Comment:1. Raptors would want more for both but definitely siakam 2. Both significantly more expensive than rui, siakam probably double, og 10m more.
Comment:#NO
Comment:Why is this realist?

Why would Toronto drop Siakam and OG?
Comment:Toronto isn‚Äôt letting them go for that cheap. I agree that if Lakers make any moves it‚Äôll likely be for a center BUT I think the buyout market will be the Lakers pick of the litter based on their performance throughout the IST. Vets are paying attention to which teams are actual contenders and how they can maximize their worth - Lakers are strong contenders and Darvin Ham is great at getting the best out of ‚Äúprove it‚Äù type players.
Comment:Toronto reportedly rejected 3 1sts for OG just last season. We‚Äôre neither offering 1) as many picks, 2) cap relief, or 3) a player they can build around. 


OG likely gets shopped around, but we just don‚Äôt have a competitive offer to make unless we trade all our picks (swaps in 26,28,30, unprotected 2029 and inverse on our 2027).
Comment:Since Nunn (Vincent) is questionable the whole year , get a POA defender in Caruso
Comment:THIS TEAM IS ON THE VERGE ON WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP TOMORROW AND YOU WANT TO TRADE PLAYERS??
Comment:Toronto has held on to OG and Siakam for years at this point. Why would Rui/1st rd pick/swaps (all we can offwr) be enough?
Comment:How about we let the team gel now that they're healthy and see where things sit as we get closer to the trade deadline
Post Title:12th Anniversary of the league robbing Kobe of 6 rings
Post Body:
Comment:This shit still pisses me off. But my consolation is the Lakers still won 17 before those bum clippers ever sniffed a conference finals.
Comment:If this trade goes down, they likely also do a deal to get Dwight Howard. Kobe and CP would have literally killed Dwight. David Stern saved Dwight‚Äôs life.
Comment:Doesn't make any sense. You're giving up a hall of fame center in the deal and Odom (forget if he was still useful)


It wouldn't have been an auto ring for that reason by any means, but I just don't understand how that could get vetoed.
Comment:What could have been ü•∂
Comment:Fuckin Dan Gilbert crybaby
Comment:Kobe got his rings. CP3 is the one who should still be livid about this.
Comment:Mark Cuban and Dan Gilbert were massive crybabies that their team would be irrelevant so they ran to daddy Dr. Ev- I mean- David Stern to whine that the other kids weren‚Äôt playing fair even though their incompetence and negligence lead them to their terrible positions in the first place. The two owners should be nowhere near a basketball team, let alone a sports team, and Stern‚Äôs rotting corpse can be hanged from his ankles to throw tomatoes at.
Comment: Getting rid of pau was not the move fr ngl
Comment:CP is a top 5 PG ever. i may not like him on other teams but him and Kobe would have been devastating for opposing teams. this was ROBBERY. don't forget it. I love Chris' play style.
Comment:Such horseshit and all parties involved were getting solid trades.
Comment:That was so fucking stupid man
Comment:![gif](giphy|vCUASy92YURGHFrnqP)
Comment:Why do we assume this pairing would work and overcome losing depth.
Comment:If you think about it, the whole veto process should have never existed to begin with. Imagine doing your best to keep a trade down low..from what i heard Mitch worked the cap to a T to get all the numbers right to even get cp3 and Dwight and space for another max. then both sides agree to it and the league gave their official stamp of approval. It of course hits the news wire and every player attached to it is already affected. You had cp3 calling up kobe. Odom and Gasol devastated. David stern did the lakers dirty. Stern basically said oh well it‚Äôs your problem now. It should never have gotten the initial approval if it was an issue. It was cause the league knew what Mitch had up his sleeves and was envious as fuck.
Comment:But the league rigs for the lakers!!!!1
Comment:lol I remember I was a commissioner for my fantasy  basketball league at the time and vetoed a trade with the comment ‚ÄúBasketball reasons‚Äù for shits and giggles.
Comment:I think the Lakers package was much better than what the hornets eventually ended up getting in my opinion.
Comment:HOU had several 1st round picks that year.
2012 1st round HOU pick ended to be 12th -Jeremy Lamb (if it came from MIL), 14, John Henson (if it‚Äôs the one traded to MIL), 16 Royce White (if from NY), 18 Terrence Jones (From Utah via MIN)
Comment:Just got a FB memory for this, where I posted something to the effect of " heats window is over, we got cp3 and we getting d12 next" lmao üò≠.
Comment:Never regret lakers fam!!
Comment:Say what you want about Adam Silver, but if he was the commissioner and not stern, I‚Äôm absolutely convinced Kobe would have gotten his 6th ring

Still my goat
Comment:Odom was never the same after this trade got rejected. Just completely screwed over Lakers fans so many ways.
Comment:man i wish we coulda seen a prime cp3 n kobe, i truly believe the experience woulda leveled up paul.

Comment:I can‚Äôt find it, but I remember someone shopping Derek Fisher‚Äôs face over Birdman and flashing something like ‚ÄúCP3 trade vetoed‚Äù on the blimp.  Shit was a ClubLakers classic.  


Comment:Ppl also forgot it completely nuked the Laker's trade asset value. Lamar wasn't the same after this and Pau left in free agency. And the rest were traded for lesser players. Even more, the Hornets were obviously trying to tank so keeping cp3 made no sense at all; and the trade after (to the Clippers) was actually not much better (if not worse). 

And for the ppl who say the veto should've happened, the league at the time also had the Heatles, and then saw the KD-Warriors... "unfair" things happen all the time, but the league didn't veto any of those things, except this.

Anyways, it's now just a big "what-if". I'm glad Pau was able to stay long enough to get his jersey retired... and I'm glad cp3 still doesn't have a ring
Comment:Man middle school, Skyrim had just come out, and the Lakers had CP3 for a couple hours üò©

Comment:Fuck Stern, Fuck Gilbert, Fuck Cuban, Fuck Pop.

Comment:tbf, the veto reason did make sense though
Comment:Fuck cp3.
Comment:Cp0 has no rings for a reason,he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten one with Kobe
Comment:I mean they did get Dwight and Steve Nash shortly after.

It didn‚Äôt turn out great but who knows what would have happened to CP3 on the lakers. Maybe egos clash, maybe he gets hurt‚Ä¶etc
Comment:Love how we had to trade Lamar for peanuts too after this because he was pissed
Comment:Is that a guaranteed ring tho? Losing both Lamar and pau and not getting a big in return would've been tough to overcome
Comment:What Kobe could have done with an elite PG. Never had one in his career. He said he hated initiating the offense. 

An underrated skill he was elite at was positioning himself offball. Not necessarily running around like Steph or Ray, although he could, but more so great at getting deep post position and feeling the leverage of the defenders to either back cut or pop out for a catch and fade away.
Comment:Ah yes.. Tradegate. David Stern and the swamp blew a whistle and called foul
Comment:Man I remember Chris Broussard breaking it down on sportscenter, I was hyped. Then they broke the news it got vetoed same day

Comment:hes amazing at one thing with very very low motivation. Youre doom if you still think hes your franchise player
Comment:What a luxury it is having the smartest player in the history of basketball for the last six years and having him balance his physical "decline" with continually increasing his mental mastery of the game.

They may end up with only one chip during LeBron's time in LA, but it's been rewarding as hell just watching this man play the game.
Comment:If you watch from 1st quarter, Zion is ready to explode, he excited as hell, but he was put in an awkward situation when Lebron started taking charge. It kind of dampen his energy, Bron put in the back of his mind that if you continue to drive, he'll be there to take the charge again and again. Not many are fast, quick and athletic enough nor brave enough to guard a rampaging Zion let alone take a charge from him. Don't be deceived by his fatness, he's lightning quick, his first step is a blur. NObody were really effective enough to guard him until Lebron, this was the first time he was blunted like this. 

Gotta give it up to this 39-yr old man giving up his body like that. What a competitor !!
Comment:Gave him that Westbrook defense that we used in the bubble. We thoroughly exposed westbrook... then traded for him

Post Title:The Lakers are a Dwight Howard from winning the title.
Post Body:I‚Äôm saying this by declaring the Nuggets as the only threat to the title. In the past week or so, I saw guys like Zubac, Valancunias, and Nurk really make Jokic work. Notice I didn‚Äôt say stop. I said work for it.

Is Dwight European strong like the guys I mentioned? No, but I think he‚Äôs the closest on the open market. Sign the man, make his sole objective to muscle and tire Jokic. It‚Äôs the way.
Comment:2023 Dwight ain‚Äôt gonna do shit to jokic except maybe seduce him but I don‚Äôt think joker swings that way.
Comment:Will be interesting  to see if, with the recent allegations against him, how other players would welcome him on an NBA team.
Comment:Man, this season reminds me a lot of 11-12 season. We have a good team with an old superstar, elite defensive team, and fans craving for Dwight to push the Lakers over the top. Depth is a lot better though, the bench sucked that year.
Comment:Nice try, Dwight
Comment:Hayes could be the answer. He has a slimmer frame than ideal, but his activity could be enough to annoy the Jokic, Embid types for a solid 10min. We‚Äôll have to see.
Comment:![gif](giphy|ai1UxGMqU7G5TZQmJa)
Comment:i will lose my mind if i hear Dwight Howard, Boogie Cousins, Serge Ibaka or any other washed center‚Äôs name. these guys are cannot keep pace with the NBA anymore and will get exploited in the playoffs. Dwight was useful for us in 2020, but even then he was right on the verge of being washed. he wasn‚Äôt yet, but very close. that was FOUR YEARS AGO now. and don‚Äôt even get me started with Boogie who‚Äôs been on the rockets, bucks, clippers, nuggets since then and cut by all of them. these guys aren‚Äôt on nba rosters for a reason. do we really think elite nba front offices trying to compete are just blind to these guys and just haven‚Äôt picked them up for some reason
Comment:Dwight in 19-20 is an exception not the norm. You‚Äôre not going to get an elite defensive center for that price. It was the perfect combo of aging star that had prior issues on other teams so there was low demand, and then he subsequently finally bought into his role
Comment:Sign Kitty for backup C minutes
Comment:Current Dwight ain‚Äôt the guy anymore, we need someone like 2020 Dwight
Comment:Someone LIKE Dwight? Sure. The actual Dwight? No. Pretty sure he is too far gone to be of value.

Comment:Just missing a former DPOY who was the best center in the league for half a decade. Y‚Äôall, that‚Äôs all we‚Äôre missing 


But seriously, I agree we need a brute, but seeing how we played last night and vs phx it looks like we‚Äôre trying to out-athlete teams. If we can give Murray trouble and he/kcp don‚Äôt go nuclear, we probably beat Denver without having a big body to throw on Jokic.
Comment:A big and reliable shooters away. 2-3 players IMO
Comment:Tbh, I rather have Hayes/Wood front Jokic and deny him the ball (Vando style). 

Or a triangle and 2 defensive strategy, with the 2  iso defenders exclusively on Murray+Jokic.
Comment:A 2020 type Dwight player for sure but not current Dwight. But I don‚Äôt think Lakers can realistically get that player.

He will never be a good defender but he‚Äôs putting in the effort. He throws some errant passes but he has no problem moving the ball and foregoing his own shots. Overall he‚Äôs been a big plus this year and last season.
Comment:He is finding the ball‚Ä¶‚Ä¶just needs to improve his ability to locate or secure it after deflection; him and Prince. Often times DLO will deflect it and him and Prince will be out of position to secure the ball or defensively which leads to easy buckets for the opponent.
Comment:Exactly. He's not going to be Alex Caruso levels of defense but the effort has greatly improved
Comment:Look at our little Derrick White üò¢

I rebuke trade talk on this sub!
Comment:But yet people on here everyday wants to trade him. Defense is about effort. He said he was going to improve and he did he really trying. We don‚Äôt need anything but health and maybe a minor move
Comment:In December
Post Title:Is it crazy to insinuate Lebron is better than he was last year?
Post Body:I would even extend that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen LeBron play at this level since 2020. He‚Äôs shooting 62.6% from 2 and 40.7% from 3, which are both career highs. He‚Äôs also still insane defensively when he‚Äôs locked in as we‚Äôve seen in the last two games. This is just fucking ridiculous atp.
Comment:i remember last year once we got to overtime it was like a death sentence cuz lebron could barely do anything out there, this year he seems to have it under control with pace
Comment:Healthier?
Comment:Nothing is surprising from Lebron at this point. He is insane and if he can keep this percentage from three throughout the season, his stats are only going to improve compared to last year.
Comment:He went to the Lebron James of feet.
Comment:Not crazy at all. He‚Äôs been amazing this season. That being said, the Lakers really need to give him some days off pretty soon. Don‚Äôt want to run LeBron into the ground too early.
Comment:I was saying that his foot really messed him up at the end of last year, now he's got his jumper back and his speed
Comment:He's healthy this year compared to half of last year.

When he was healthy, he also had a shittier team to deal with. He probably had to play more defense more because if he didn't, we would have plugged Austin at Center or something crazy.
Comment:He is better. That‚Äôs a fact. He‚Äôs balling like he‚Äôs 21 and not season 21
Comment:He was struggling with a nagging injury last year. Combined w being healthy, he‚Äôs also in an insane groove where his jumper is cash
Comment:its not. Lebron last season played with 1 and a half leg. AT least at the end of a season
Comment:He is way better this yr than last yr.
Comment:No he was just as good last year. Remember his birthday and when he passed Kareem? Those were 40+ point performances if I remember correctly. It‚Äôs just that the team sucked at first so it wasn‚Äôt as obvious. And then he got injured‚Ä¶ Now he‚Äôs back to pre injury
Comment:He's not hurt and his stats are all better, so he absolutely is.
Comment:He was injured last season
Comment:He is absolutely better than last year. Why is this even a question? He was hurt last year and played through pain most of the season.
Comment:He is. He was hurt last year
Comment:I mean Ham said he was better this year
Comment:I'd say he is about how he was before he got his first ankle injury last season, when he was averaging like 30 8 and 6 or sum like that. He's shooting percentages have also improved because he actually has some decent shooters around him now, so he has more space to drive which forces defences to step off allowing for better shots. All up I'd say he seems to be playing like 2020 championship Bron but without having to be the main PG, he seems just as athletic as ever his threes are dropping and his defence is great when he locks in. Still a top 3-5 player on any given nighy
Comment:We just need to keep his minutes down and keep him healthy. He's absolutely playing better than he played last year, but he had that foot injury too...
Comment:Why would it be crazy? Have you forgot he played through injury for a good portion last season?
Comment:Not at all... he's also healthier... look at the monster he was before the foot injury last year... üí™üèæüí™üèæ
Comment:![gif](giphy|6hzcLwqQ7AH4fPNR59)
Comment:He's not playing hurt.
Comment:It was hard watching him inching by people driving and in visible discomfort jumping /shooting play offs last year now he‚Äôs healthy he‚Äôs back gliding like a cheetah
Comment:He doesn't have to kill himself on defense anymore.
Comment:Thank you LeBron James of feet for working a miracle
Comment:I think he's always been this good, it's just a matter of trying. Weather it's injuries or just taking games off and saving himself for the playoffs he's always had an excuse to not try. Right now he's fully healthy with plenty of help, every time you hear his name it's followed by questions about his age. 

Right now he just has every reason to try again even in the regular season. But no, he isn't better... He's just bron.
Comment:He was dealing with a lot of small injuries last year
Comment:You're not crazy bro. It's LeBron who's crazy cause how tf does he play better in Year 21
Comment:He‚Äôs recovered from injuries, he‚Äôs happier than a year ago, and he‚Äôs trying harder early in the season because of the tournament.
Comment:After last year I thought he was fringe top ten. Still insane but not the same player.

This season thus far has me convinced he‚Äôs still top 3 in the world with Jokic and Giannis. Just hope he can stay healthy.
Comment:He is better this year
Comment:I think we have to temper our exceptions. We've never seen players put under pressure this early into the season. LeBron is fresh right now and he's putting up playoff numbers in a playoff style games. 

However, we have to wait to see what this team will look like in April and May. If the Lakers are still depending on Bron for everything, I doubt he can keep up. An IST cup is nice, but the Lakers play for NBA chips.
Comment:LeBron‚Äôs shooting is way up from last season
Comment:I think we've gotta lower our "age slowdown" view when it comes to elite athletes these days, especially Lebron. 3 of the top 10 guys in the league are in their mid-to-late 30s and many more of those guys are in their 30s. 

This isn't even anomalous to basketball, look at every other sport and you have athletes breaking age-records. It's why all these analytics machines are so bad at predicting the Lakers (or any team with elite older players), they just assume that an older player is gonna play worse, when that doesn't necessarily happen. Father time is undefeated, but these days you have to wait-and-see it to say so.
Comment:Stem cells are a hell of a thaaang
Comment:He is though
Comment:He‚Äôs playing better cuz the team is much better and he‚Äôs not hurt. I don‚Äôt think he is any better or worse as a player. What he does on both sides of the ball. + leadership when he‚Äôs engaged is still the best player in the league. Better than Gianni‚Äôs, Jokic, Embid (lol) and it‚Äôs all dependent on the game context, health, and situation
Comment:Yeah. Let‚Äôs be real, his 3 point shot was broken last year
Comment:Lebron:

![gif](giphy|J1QcNGubdJPESH1bPo|downsized)
Comment:He is. He addressed his injury, he‚Äôs making up for that time!
Comment:Lebron has been dealing with some form of injury for basically the past 3 seasons. People started sleeping on 'Bron to some degree because we had never seen him injured until 20/21. The last time he was fully healthy...he won a championship. Last year he was dealing with the foot issue. He had the surgery (I assume) in the offseason, and he is now fully healthy for basically the first time since that championship run.
Comment:100% he‚Äôs playing better and it isn‚Äôt really a discussion.  He was clearly dealing with injuries because to start the year he wasn‚Äôt driving nearly as much and relied heavily on threes while only shooting in the mid to low 30s.  

Throughout the year he cut back on the threes but he was clearly struggling with his burst because he wasn‚Äôt nearly as effective.  Now it seems his burst is fully back and he can get to the rim at will.  Add that he‚Äôs shooting 40% from 3, which opens driving lanes even more, and he‚Äôs unstoppable
Comment:Dude was playing hurt for a lot of last year‚Ä¶and prior to that he was playing w a shit roster and Westbrook. So definitely yes
Comment:Last year he was being asked to do much pre trade deadline and maybe it affected him ever so slightly. He‚Äôs more happy this year.
Comment:This is like his most efficient shooting season since 2014 lmao. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs playing better than he has since the bubble.
Comment:The difference is he is healthy coming into this season. You can tell he got bounce in his step.
Comment:He is playing better this year than last year.
Comment:Nope. Also, He's just finally healthy
Comment:He's definitely better than he was last year. I think he went IN on training / conditioning this past summer. He knows his window is closing, and he wants to get over the top one more time.

You see it again and again. Some guys, like LeBron, are just gifted with great physical attributes, but the guys who are most consistently great are the ones who TRAIN HARD. The main reason LeBron is doing this at this age is his regimen.

It's also why watching someone like DLo be so inconsistent is so frustrating. It's almost always a training / conditioning problem, rather than just some inherent genetic flaw.

Most people cannot keep up that same obsessive level of work that Bron, Kobe, MJ, and the other greats do. That's the separator.
Comment:Last year seeing him play I felt that was the first year that his age is finally starting to show a little bit and that he did noticeably regress. 

Seeing him this year realize I was wrong and it was not age but the injury that slowed him down.
Comment:He's playing a lot better than The LeBron we had in the playoffs, post foot injury. LeBron was never washed last season, he was just injured. In my opinion, if we had this LeBron against the nuggets we might have won that series.
Comment:S/o to that German doctor üôèüôèüôè
Comment:A healthy Lebron is still a top 3 player in league at 39 years of age. If he is healthy and looking like he did last night in April-June‚Ä¶. We gonna have another chip.
Comment:He‚Äôs healthy. His foot was really ailing him for the last half of the season last year.
Comment:It‚Äôs not crazy to insinuate, but it‚Äôs more complex than that. #1 He was really good last year until he started getting hurt. #2 Basketball is easier when the team around you is better.
Comment:I mean you already pointed out why he's playing better so it's definitely not crazy. What's crazy is the fact is that he is actually better lmao
Comment:Well, if his shot-making improvement exceeded the degradation of his aging body.. then YES!
Comment:I think he is definitely moving better. He has his fast explosiveness back. I like that he isn't settling for those faded mid range shots. He seems to be driving more to the hoop. Doing that just creates so many opportunities for his teammates to get open looks.
Comment:He‚Äôs not only more explosive than last year, but his jumper is falling at an elite level too. To be fair, a lot of that is shot selection, as he‚Äôs taken far fewer exhaustion 3s this year, but still he‚Äôs been much more efficient on outside shots.
Comment:He is better.  Probably because he is healthy.

If the Lakers keep playing defense at a high level, he is going to be able to cut back on his minutes quite significantly.
Comment:He is better.
Comment:Def better and you can tell he loves this roster
Comment:Reminds me of 2014 Lebron
Comment:100% he‚Äôs better this year, this is best I‚Äôve seen him ever since that Solomon Hill injury and that was over 2.5 years ago.
Comment:It‚Äôs hard to judge. Last year he played the majority of the season with injured teammates, Westbrook, and with his own injury. 

There‚Äôs no telling how well he would‚Äôve played if he was healthy and with this current squad . He was averaging 30 with bad teammates and bad spacing before his injury.
Comment:I don‚Äôt discount the first ever NBA in season tournament trophy plus $500k as strong motivators for everyone on the team right now. But LBJ definitely kicked major ass last night and I love to see it! AD needs to stay angry and maybe let the hair out. Team looks bigger in the gold unis.
Comment:I‚Äôve said this many times - I think he‚Äôs the best been since the Solomon hill injury full stop. The fact he has the gear he‚Äôs shown the last few games makes us very very scary. When Bron is on, he‚Äôs the best player in the world. At worst - he‚Äôs second behind Jokic.
Comment:He seems half a step faster and is shooting just about as well as he has in his career. I heard there was some junk in his foot/ankle that got cleaned up during his surgery as well and that was probably holding him back
Comment:He still had plantar fasciitis all of last season, long before the torn tendon. It affected him in a lot of ways. He's clearly healthier than he's been since pre-Solomon Hill. I'm dying on the hill that he got surgery.
Comment:Westbrook would lose us leads and turn the ball over a ton, forcing a lot of our games to go down to the wire. I‚Äôm loving what I‚Äôm seeing and the efficiency in blowouts help with extra rest. IMO that‚Äôs contributed to an improvement in his numbers.
Comment:Nope, LeBron‚Äôs intellect will never fade but his durability/athleticism has steadily declined. But he was dropping from such ridiculous heights that he‚Äôs still a top tier athlete in the league. 

We‚Äôve seen it frequently in his Lakers tenure how people mistake playing through injuries for a decline. Saw it in 2021/2023 playoffs and LeBron comes back going crazy. When he‚Äôs healthy, LeBron is still arguably a top 5 guy.
Comment:LeBron has aged like fine wine. His testosterone just goes up and up, with each and every LeBarrier and LeCeiling in his way. That‚Äôs the LeMovement that he‚Äôs defined to re do it better, faster, and stronger than any previous version of himself. The man is the Stink Meaner of Basketball. A bad  grandfather ass whooping motherfucker from the  O h i o ‚Äî man will be 70 some years from now, still flopping as if he‚Äôs got ballerina toes on broadway. That said. He‚Äôs good.
Comment:Post Title:Anthony Davis: The Picture of Consistency
Post Body:If you look at the box score (specifically stopping after points, which most pundits seem to do) then Anthony Davis had a so-so game last night. While his 15 boards were great, he "only" scored 16 points. Pretty sure the TNT crew after the game were talking about how "inconsistent" Anthony Davis has been. These people then get that narrative running, and now Anthony Davis is constantly saddled with being "too inconsistent" to lead a team.

It's like getting paid to talk about basketball doesn't require actually watching basketball.

Anthony Davis' defense is not just good. It's not even just great. It's generational. He is the only player in this league now that basically guarantees you a top 10 defense just by being on the court. The Lakers were hovering around 10th for most of the season even as their defensive guards and wings were basically all injured. I watched him during the Suns game completely wall off the paint one play, and then switch onto Devin Booker on the perimeter and completely lock him down in iso coverage. He covers for so many mistakes and lets wing defenders pressure without worry of getting beaten. When James Harden said "I'm not a system player, I am a system" Anthony Davis is the defensive version of that (the only difference is, in AD's case, it's actually true)

Frankly, I'm not even remotely surprised at how suffocating the Laker defense has been since Vando, Rui, and Cam have all come back. Imagine having to contend with an army of long, physical wings on the perimeter, just to get by them only to find Anthony fucking Davis waiting for you. 

The crazy thing about AD's defense is that he's generational basically every game. Shaq once said "if the big dog don't get fed, the house don't get guarded" implying that letting him cook on offense was what motivated him to actually try on defense. But AD locks up and runs this defense even when the Laker guards decide to look everywhere but him for offense (which happens WAY too much btw...) 

I don't blame AD for fluctuating scoring numbers: it's exhausting having to captain an entire defense. AD doesn't complain, he puts his head down and goes to work. He'll have games where he'll get 30 points while shutting a team down, and games where he gets 16 and shuts a team down. Both are great games in my view. 

AD can only be considered inconsistent if we stop looking at his impact after the "points" column. If we evaluate a "good" AD game as him doing his job of anchoring our defense well, rebounding the ball, and adding some scoring, AD is the picture of consistency. I am so glad he's a Laker
Comment:Defensively he is amazing, no doubt about it. But I think everyone will admit, that there are just some games where he simply disappears. Especially, if it is a game against top centers like Embiid and Jokic. Sometimes he won't even attempt a single shot for one half. I don't know it has to do with his confidence, or something else, but he is definitely inconsistent offensively.
Comment:Tbh, anthony davis is literally a game changer on defensive. His effort/intent is focused on that end, we have the est scorer to ever exist in lebron so i dont care what the pundits say.

&amp;#x200B;

IF lebron has a good year, if hes healthy we are winning the chip(and it looks like he is, his per is highest since injury)
Comment:I think this unfortunately comes down to how Defense is a lot more neglected and elusive for viewers. Even advance stats are better at capturing offensive output then defense. AD absolutely is a phenomenon impact player base on defense alone. He is almost gobert without being cooked by guards at this point
Comment:I agree. Even not scoring and having a subpar game he still alters so many shots in the paint and his rebounding is getting other guys buckets as they push the ball.
Comment:There are games where he needs to shoot more to try and score more when the team needs it but there are a lot of games where he doesn't. Lakers were up 12-13 at halftime last game and had scored 67 points and people were crying about AD having 6. People think you can just add 10 on for AD without taking away some from others.
Comment:As long as Bron, D Lo, and Big City are creating shots for themselves and others , it takes a lot of pressure off AD . When we feed him in the post , he‚Äôs either gotta shoot that mid range or bang in the paint for a bucket , and it‚Äôs obviously ideal for him to conserve his energy for defense . 

What‚Äôs wild is with this entire anti-AD narrative in the media ‚Ä¶. Jokic is the single dude standing in his way to it being a 180. If AD could match Joker in a 7 game series where the Lakers prevail, there will not be a single word of shade about him in the press. He‚Äôs gotta make it personal with that dude. He‚Äôs fucking w his legacy frfr
Comment:AD is a fucking monster. We'll be hanging his jersey one day mark my words.
Comment:It sounds like an excuse but it‚Äôs valid
Comment:The media always said that WB is always playing at 100%. That show the basic elementary analysis that these media do. They don't know what defense is, thats why the they give Gobert that much of DPOY, or how a fucking Reddit post influence them to pick JJJ
Comment:Well said. AD is integral.
Comment:Also there's a narrative that you have to be a scorer. AD didn't need to get 20+ points last night. When you have the all time scorer on your team he takes the load off of you. They also have role players who step up so he can be an all defensive player without worrying about offense
Comment:The problem is that 75% percent of AD's offense is assisted. He can not create for himself.
Comment:I always put it plainly.

No player since Hakeem Olajuwon has been asked to do what he is asked to do 

put up 27/12 while also COMPLETELY ANCHORING A DEFENSE.

It‚Äôs not a common ask, it‚Äôs not an easy task and yet he does it on the offensive end damn near every night and the Defense never wavers.
Comment:This title is super ChatGPT-esque.
Comment:You are 100% correct... I'd go a step further... 

His offensive "inconsistencies" are more a product of a lack of touches &amp; shots than anything else. If he's at 17-18 + shots he's basically a guaranteed 25 + points.
Comment:The thing about consistency is you can only have a chance of consistently doing your actual role.  If you're not the primary scorer by design, then your scoring will be opportunistic and therefore inconsistent (this applies to our role players too...not a DLo fan, but of course his scoring is up and down, same for AR, Rui and any other of our points contributors)

Completely agree on AD's defence.  I'd be tempted to put Gobert in that same bracket (and of course, he doesn't get the same pressure/expectation to be a scorer)
Comment:AD is probably the best co-captain Bron can have at this point in his career, because let's face where LeBron is in his career is kind of a mirror of AD; still a masterful offensive player, here and there on defense (he can be great on defense, but only in the playoffs or IST). It's just that the entire league is viewed in such an offensive lens.

Our old friend Frank Vogel said it best: AD is a generational defensive player who happens to be really good on offense. Put it another way: if a player was generational offensively and happened to be really good on defense, they'd be the favorite for the MVP.
Comment:I came here to post this, well said!!
Comment:Facts. I saw some tweet yesterday regarding his statline and being compared to Rudy. Yeah ok he scored just in the teens, but having that offensive production basically equals a good night for Rudy Gobert as they are most likely head to head in terms of defense.
Comment:This happened in the playoffs too. If AD scores 15ish points on like 10 shot attempts while shutting down an entire team's offense then doesn't play the 4th quarter because we won in a blowout, his per game scoring drops and it gets added to his list of bad or inconsistent games when realistically he played a phenomenal game.
Comment:AD has been the same player his whole life. He averaged 14-11 at Kentucky and was a defensive God. Even in the final, when he didn't have it on offense, he deferred and just played D and won the title. People expect too much from him offensively. Guy is a hell of a player.
Comment:I remember AD playing for Kentucky told his teammates that he won‚Äôt be focused as much on scoring but putting the emphasis on defense. Glad he brought that mentality to the league. Even through the injury riddled years. I‚Äôm glad we even have him. Generational talent on D. Gets a lot of flak on offense, but his defense is never questioned
Comment:See the thing is you don‚Äôt give up all of those players and picks to get a guy who is elite defensively and inconsistent on offense.


He‚Äôs supposed to be the next coming of Duncan or Garnett. He needs to bring it on both ends of the floor every night.
Comment:Facts and to give more emphasis of our wings coming back. Ever since Vando, Rui, and Cam came back, it unlocked AD to go all in on the defensive side. When they were all gone, AD had to be the key rim protector and switch defender, AND had to be the primary rebounder at all times which is why other teams kept getting offensive rebounds constantly. With our wings back, AD can focus on defending knowing our wings are gonna crash the glass.
Comment:Bro it‚Äôs so crazy how i saw ppl in the game thread saying AD sucks after he missed a dunk I believe. The man had 15 boards and anchors our defense. If bron and the other guys play how they played last night honestly I think it takes pressure off of him Offensively and allows him to lock in on Defense and score when needed. Like bro the people who shit on him are literally comical üòÇ
Comment:Not to disagree with your overall point, but Anthony Davis is the only guy in the league for whom 15/16/5 with 4 stocks and just two turnovers (in 30 minutes) would be considered a bad game. 

If he played regular minutes, he‚Äôs likely got a 20/20 or better and people would still say he ‚Äúscored quietly‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt take over‚Äù. It‚Äôs an absurd standard he is held to.
Comment:AD certainly is a presence in the lane on defense. Maybe the thing on offense is, he doesn't really have a post up game. He's fine at pick and rolls and lob dunks, but he often settles for a mid range jumper which is not anything close to a consistent shot for him. I love AD but he's not in a class with Jokic or Giannis.

with Vando and Rui back, the Lakers now have a deep bench and defensive prowness that will allow LeBron to be a team defender and not have to guard a top opponent. With his basketball IQ, it'll lead to more steals and more transition scores for him.

 I do worry about the minutes, though. It may lead to an injury later in the season.

Can he and AD stay healthy? Hopefully

Is Austin Reeves' game growing everyday? absolutely

Is AD inconsistent, or unable to deliver strong individual offensive performances?

If your expecting him to score 20+ most every night, you're mistaken......
Comment:AD is quietly moving up the ladder of All Time Laker greats.
Comment:Now imagine if Ham create plays for him and the outside shooters hit at least 40% open threes. Last night‚Äôs game was a pure example. Defense was all on him double or triple teamed but it doesn‚Äôt matter coz they‚Äôre hitting threes and he only had to focus on defense.
Comment:I agree I just wish his jumper that we see every preseason would stick in the regular season.
Comment:Very well written! You got me hype af lmfao
Comment:Great post. What Lebron is to our offense, AD is to our defense.
Comment:Great post. One thing I want to add re: AD‚Äôs scoring. He has 3 other capable scorers around him outside of LeBron (DLo, Austin, Rui) so PPG will naturally go down just as it has for LeBron (it‚Äôs his lowest PPG since his rookie year. The metrics points to AD not only being great defensively but also offensively. It‚Äôs just that he ‚Äúonly‚Äù averages 23 a game so casuals will think he hasn‚Äôt been good offensively.

He and LeBron have been 1A and 1B in terms of best on the team. Don‚Äôt know why others are so reluctant to mention it. The tape and the stats literally back up the claim that AD has been just as good as LeBron despite casual takes perpetuated by fans that know very little about basketball.
Comment:People act like these guys have unlimited energy... The two most annoying complaints I hear are that AD has too many off nights and LBJ doesn't drive to the hoop enough.   


For AD, he plays defense in a way that has him all over the place. He isn't just a rim protector who blocks shots. He can defend all positions and does so on most plays. This takes a LOT of energy. If he produces on offense, he won't be able to keep that up the same way. I feel this is why he settles for mid range jumpers from time to time since he can't play with that defensive energy and also post up against physical centers every trip down the floor.   


For Bron, the guy is almost 39 years old... Acting like he can just drive to the rim and take significant contact every play is so stupid. He picks his moments when the team really needs it (stopping runs, getting a bucket when we are stagnant, etc.) but otherwise let the guy pick teams apart with his brain.
Comment:The dude's only problem is health.

**IF** he manages to stay healthy for a significant period of time, aka gather some fucking momentum and rythm, he's a monster.

He gets injured a lot, though. And he doesn't come back well from injuries, there are people like Steph, Kyrie, Durant who can get injured for like 2 weeks, and the first game back be like they never left, AD's the exact opposite, it's like his meter goes back to 0 every time he gets a knock. 

That's the only problem with him. If he stays healthy, even if he doesn't score, he's unbelievable.

That's the only truth.
Comment:AD can avg 35+ points for a week and then "only" score 20 points the next game and get called soft. If this sounds like a specific example, it is because its happens with him all the time. The lens that AD gets judged through is crazy unfair.

Its especially frustrating because it should be the opposite. AD should be given more leeway because our offense often is not very good at getting him the ball. We don't usually have like a PG who specializes in passing. D Lo and Reaves are great scoring guards not necessary great passers. Lebron is great at passing but when its just him teams can start working their defense around it and easily cut off passing lanes to AD. If AD doesn't have a lot of points its usually because the defense made it their mission to cut off AD and for better or worse the Lakers roll with it and don't force the ball to him.
Comment:The thing is he needs to be the best player on the team and the number 1 option over Bron to make it easier for Bron. What Bron doing remarkable but he almost 39. AD is a great defender but fans want the 2020 AD who could cook from the iso and shoot mid ranges thats what we want. The type of player he is on offense is not gonna be conducive long term. He went from a 3 way scorer to a 1 way thats a problem. He hasn‚Äôt improved his offensive game.
Comment:Hes always been great on defense its his scoring thats super shakey. The thing is he getting paid 40 mill bro. He is expected to be the scorer especially with a lot riding for Bron each season. If he was on another team no one would care as much but when u next to Bron u playing to help his legacy too. Bron needs someone he can rely on as a bucket. AD hasn‚Äôt been that since 2020. Part of it could be how he used, but he needs to demand the ball more.
Comment:Better be playing legendary defense and "just" score 16 points. 

Than drop 30 every night but give up just as much if not more on the other end. 

I still wished his jumpshots were falling but at the end of the day, it is what it is. Dude destroyed the Grizzlies almost by himself on the defensive end.
Comment:Casuals in shambles. As I've said before, with the amount of injuries we had to start the season, it's fucking insane that we're actually 5 games above .500. ADPOY is on the way everyone along with the King who is playing like he's 28.
Comment:I've always looked at AD as Lakers' Minister of Defense and Lebron as our Maestro of Offense, together they complement each other. This is their true identity and this is what they're consistent about, but both of them are very flexible and switchable that's why they are a perfect pairing; and in my opinion, given the right roster, they are still the best duo in this small ball generation like they were in 2020.
Comment:Honestly it‚Äôs funny either AD, I think it‚Äôs the opposite of what Shaq said. If he‚Äôs doing bad on defense then that‚Äôs when he‚Äôs not in a groove offensively. Also I don‚Äôt get why we keep having this narrative of ADs scoring. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that LeBron is the offense and he can have these crazy numbers because he knows AD has got his back on defense. If LeBron had to put more energy into defense than I‚Äôm sure that would take from his offensive output.
Comment:Basketball media is a joke tbh. We should really be celebrating his defensige greatness.
Comment:AD is the perfect fit with Lebron. One offensive system, and one defensive system. End of story. Surround them with capable players above 6‚Äô4 and it‚Äôs a yearly championship contender yearly.
Comment:Hoop Collective talked about potential DPOY winners this week for like 10 minutes and didn‚Äôt mention AD once.  Instead their choices were Gobert (fair), Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis, and Chet Holmgren
Comment:Thank you. AD is also defended differently. He‚Äôs the focal point of an opposing team‚Äôs defense. They shrink the floor to keep him out of the low post. They shrink the floor to keep him from getting 1 v 1 matchups. 

AD impacts a defense the way any other superstar impacts an offense. While putting up 22-26 ppg. Meanwhile, there are superstars who can get away with playing half assed defense as long as they‚Äôre putting up offensive numbers.
Comment:I agree he‚Äôs a beast defensively, but he can be much better offensively. Both are true. There‚Äôs no reason he can‚Äôt be a 26/12 guy with his defense. He was that and more in 2020 and his pelicans years. He just completely lacks confidence in his jumper, evident as he airballed a wide open mid range yesterday and almost air balled a wide open 3. His free throw percentage shows me that he has the mechanics to be a good mid range shooter, it‚Äôs all mental
Comment:Exactly!

While it would be nice for his outside shot to be more consistent, he is still a game changer on the floor.
Comment:Great post man. I completely agree, although there are some games where he looks lethargic and seems to be going through the motions offensively, there is no question that he is the rock and anchor of this Laker team which hangs it's hat on the defensive end. He makes us such a competitive roster with his shot blocking and shot altering ability but even more than that, he gives tough defenders like Vando, Rui and Reddish a bit more of a leash to be more reactionary to feints because they know AD is there waiting to send their shot attempt into the 8th row. They're finding their groove and AD is such a HUGE reason why.
Comment:It‚Äôs honestly fun to watch this team play defense, and even in the darkness of the Westbrook era, AD‚Äôs defensive domination was a beacon in the night.

I actually prefer AD averaging 20-23 points instead of 25+, if it means role players are stepping up. That way he can be the Jokic of defense without destroying his body.
Comment:Super well written and 100% correct. The quote from Shaq is a great point -- AD is basically the opposite of that. Watching him, it looks like he really loves playing defense. Not to mention how exhausting it is to do what he does on that end of the court.
Comment:Oh boy another long winded text post telling us why the guy we signed to a 5 year max to be the franchise corner stone should be above valid criticism to his declining offense. People who are paid AD money can do both. Embiid and Giannis are 30ppg first options who also play dpoy level defense, rebound and do all the other things too. 

We know he plays defense, but we signed him to a 5 year max expecting him to shoot better than 15% from mid range and not put up 2 point halves.
Comment:No one shits on Kawhi for not playing elite defense anymore. He used to be a DPOY annual contender. And now because he's been so injury prone, he focuses most of his energy on scoring. Same goes for Gobert. He's inept on offense and is good for just lobs. AD is a generational defender that raises our team to another level. And expecting him to average 20-25 ppg is a lot to ask of him. There is a reason why two way players are extremely hard to find. the energy you have to expend on both sides of court is not sustainable. Only freaks of nature can do it for 30-35 minutes a game.
Comment:Not just this, but he does most of Lebron‚Äôs job on defense for 3/4 of the game and STILL is the best help defender in the league. He‚Äôs as impactful as adding 2 all-nba level defenders imo.
Comment:I completely agree with all of this. Also, do people not realize he didn‚Äôt play the 4th? He would‚Äôve probably ended around 24 or more had the game called for it
Comment:I always thought it was dumb how if a player drops 30 and plays 0 defense (Dame) they are praised. Whereas if a player drops 15 and plays all-time great defense (AD) it‚Äôs a bad game?

Comment:Stay away from him, pls
Comment:I'm going to keep repeating until I speak it into existence but I'd rather have Javon carter and Drummond. With the way cam, vando and the rest of our wings are playing defence I think adding another insurance type of poa defender in carter and a real rebounding center in Drummond would be much better

Comment:If we get AC he would basically fill Dlos minutes. I‚Äôd rather have an excellent defender and someone who can knock down the occasional three than Dlo doing postseason Dlo things. Someone must have told Cam hey‚Ä¶if you work your butt off and defend you‚Äôll go from making 2.5mm a year to 12mm easy
Comment:Only thing I would want the lakers to upgrade on is another center/power forward. 

We don‚Äôt need Alex, we have Reaves for offense and we have Vando/Reddish who can defend.
Comment:I honestly don't understand how caruso would work with us rn. Our size and defense is good. Offense is the thing to improve right? Also don't want lavine. I really like this team and hope no one leaves unless they don't get minutes.
Comment:Caruso come home baby!
Comment:These dudes are literally reading the sentiment of the subreddit and using it to draw a plausible conclusion but very unlikely outcome.
Comment:We don't need him, I love the chemistry we are building up right now.
Comment:Why not ask for Bron and AD for Lavine too, while we are at it? Seems a fair trade where we will have the Lakers, Bron, AD, AR, DLo, Rui making a team with Caruso because Zach is THE thing? /s

No one in their right mind would trade AR, Rui together for a Zach kind of Mr 2ppg guy (I know it's a slump, yet the form matters for us rn). No, even DLo seems to be better than Zach. 

They are trying to pincer us into trading more than what is worth to get Alex. Else, why would they be willing to part with their all star in Zach but not "just another starter"? 

And as much as I love Alex, I won't make these same trades, even if you replaced Zach with Alex. Not possible.
Comment:If the FO is dead set on adding a ‚Äúthird option‚Äù I think Jerami Grant is a much better option than LaVine.  Both are overpaid but Grant is making $11M less per year, a better defender, and still adds a scoring punch.

I‚Äôm still wary of trading D‚Äôlo purely because playmaking is a struggle for this team already.  Rui, Gabe or a Rui, Prince, JHS package works salary matching wise after January 15th.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think we should do it.  Our team is finally getting healthy, let‚Äôs see what this team looks like and hopefully we don‚Äôt even need a trade.  I just think it‚Äôs better than LaVine or even DeRozan.  A Reaves/Reddish/Grant/Lebron/AD closing lineup would be good defensively and offensively.
Comment:His contract is too big. I am trying to think of the worst package Lakers can give up for him and that still to me seems too much. But Bulls would also want a pick and few of our young guys. Not worth at all. If we make a trade I rather get someone else.
Comment:Lavine is not the answer, unless the question is "Name a player the Lakers should not go after?"
Comment:I don‚Äôt want him
Comment:Fuck off with these Zach Lavine bait articles. If it ain‚Äôt AC coming home idc.
Comment:Hb we just don‚Äôt want him lol if we trade dlo AND rui i think you need to get some legit two way talent and idk who that is but ik it‚Äôs not Zach

Post Title:Who can play high level basketball in 39 aside from a goat?
Post Body:LeBron James turns 39 this month and  still looking good. Aging like fine wine has been the theme during his Lakers Era of Greatness. James has been know to put his money on his conditioning and everything related to him playing his best basketball everyday, every game of his life to play "King" like he is. He even seek the LeBron James of ankles and is now rejuvenated like ever.(Lets all appreciate that Doctor). But also, LeBron is a special specimen, a generational athlete, have genes of something we have yet to know until Bronny puts his own name on the box score. With the medical and technological advancement we have now, who do you think has the potential to even scratch what this old man, in his last year of 30's, with grey hairs on his chin and bald spots on his head, playing like an mvp, is doing right now? KD and Curry are still elite in their age right now. Can they? Most of the young guys are with their own injuries lingering in them, can they play and average 20ppg at 39??
Comment:I remember watching Michael play at 39. It was not pretty.....

Someone could come along that could be like Bron. They would have to have the talent, drive, and skills of LeBron, Kobe, Michael, join the league at 18, be lucky with injuries and be lucky to have a body that responds well to the grind and off-season preparation.

Simply put, genes, mentality and some luck. It could happen but the percentages are in the low single digits.
Comment:The biggest thing I‚Äôve noticed about Lebron is he‚Äôs not doing as much and he‚Äôs more efficient. 

He‚Äôs not taking all those step back and iso threes which are tough inefficient shots. His three ball is falling because he‚Äôs getting the ball on the perimeter when his feet are set and it‚Äôs not a catch and shoot but he‚Äôs in a good spot to elevate and shoot. 

It seems like he is getting the ball and when looking to create is attacking the rim or drive and kicking and then if there‚Äôs a good look the team shoots. If not Dlo or AR or AD resets. It‚Äôs how he‚Äôs been able to play hard but not expend the energy he did last year. 

Seems like he just trusts his teammates much more (AR and Dlo and AD to create and TP and CR and Rui to hit shots) unlike last year when he had no trust in anyone and tried to do too much. 

He‚Äôs also probably healthier this year than last year. Overall very pleased with the start to this team.
Comment:Honestly, the only player I see being able to play as good as LeBron at 39 is Jokic. 

He play style is relatively slow and mainly based on skills. 

He's a great shooter and passer. He's a very smart player. 

Those things don't really fade a lot with time.
Comment:Pretty soon a two point or mid range shot will be obsolete. It will be frowned upon to shoot a midrange.

Comment:Anyone else at that age was washed up &amp; definitely wasn‚Äôt playing high level basketball with title aspirations. Majority of past stars be washed a couple years after turning 30, it‚Äôs amazing what he‚Äôs still doing. But it‚Äôs getting overlooked because it‚Äôs LeBron.
Comment:Lakers are still a very good team and made the western conference finals last year.  Lebron is a major impact on the teams success.  I think that is what separates Lebron from Jordan in this discussion.  

Jordan was still a very good player at 38 and 39 putting up multiple 40 point games during those years and playing 82 games at 39 averaging 22 and 20 ppg, but his teams were bad.  

At later years Jordans type of game didn't impact winning the way Lebron's does.
Comment:KD and Curry have a decent shot just because of how they play the game. I bet their defense absolutely falls off a cliff by then though, they‚Äôve already seen a drop off on that side of the ball. Not that LeBron is constantly awesome on D, but he still can be at times and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way they‚Äôll have that in their bag at 39, since they barely have it now

Comment:Why is the warriors this stupid so many TOs
Comment:During the off-season one of the NBA analysts gave an interesting take that I‚Äôve been thinking about recently.  

The Lakers decided to waive Mo Bamba and declined Malik Beasley‚Äôs contract saving $26.8M total.  This put us under the tax line which allowed us to use the full MLE to get Gabe Vincent.  Good move; Bamba isn‚Äôt worth $10M and Beasley isn‚Äôt worth $16M.

However, this analyst thought a higher upside move would‚Äôve been to keep Bamba and Beasley‚Äôs $26M purely for the trade upside.  From my understanding, you‚Äôd still have the TPMLE and maybe even the BAE. 

Then, if you wanted a Zach LaVine, Jerami Grant, DeRozan, etc you‚Äôd already have $26M salary match in players you wouldn‚Äôt mind losing.

Edit:  I‚Äôm not saying this is a good idea, just wanted peoples‚Äô opinions on if we made the right move

Comment:For the folks going crazy about Anthony Davis scoring 16 points last night, I think we need to remember basketball isn‚Äôt always a game of ‚Äúwhat individual scored more than the other best player‚Äù. It‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat *team* scored more‚Äù 

Giannis and Dame combined for 60+ against the Pacers. And they still lost. Giannis DOMINATED the Pacers at 37 points! But the Bucks lost. Again - is the goal of basketball to win games or get the most individual stats? 

Defense still matters. 

If you want a player who plays for his individual stats and not team basketball focused on winning, go back to watching Russell Westbrook. A guy who puts his stats above everything else.

Comment:Post Title:Top Defense of the Season: Regular Season Best DEFRTG at 106.0 - Lakers' DEFRTG in IST Stands at 102.3
Post Body:In the IST, the Lakers are crushing it on defense with a DEFRTG of 102.3, beating out the regular season's best of 106.0. They're leading by a considerable margin, as other top defenses are around a DEFRTG of 106 or more.  


With 10th Lebron's prime, ADPOY, AustHIM, and the ball falling, nobody is beating us.

Go Lakeshow!!!
Comment:I‚Äôm as high as anybody on the Lakers and think their defense should be stifling with the return of Vanderbilt and Cam (on paper should be a top-5 when healthy), but I‚Äôd take stats from the IST games specifically with a grain of salt. 

The Lakers have played some very poor offensive teams, to say the least. They‚Äôll get a real test on that end tomorrow with the way the Pacers are playing.
Comment:Same strengths of our last playoffs run with improved healthy of our superstars replacing a couple of backup SG able to get hot every now and then for a steady defender.

We still don't have someone to protect the paint when Davis sits, but unlike Gabriel, Hayes has legit size for a C.

I guess most folks trust Dlo to perform in his 4th playoffs attempt. I hope you are right. IST is the closest thing we have to playoffs and I wasn't personally amazed by his performance against the Suns and the Pels in win or go home games.

Do we have any idea when we can expect him back or at least whether he‚Äôs progressing well or not. With Rui and Vando finally back, I just wanna see this team fully healthy for once

Comment:There was, but I‚Äôm not optimistic based on the language.

I am completely on board with trading him, ideally for Caruso (who‚Äôs shooting 45+% from 3), though that would require draft capital. Imagine a Caruso, Cam, LeBron, Vando, AD defensive lineup. Yeah the spacing sucks, but NOBODY is scoring on that.

Post Title:Has anyone else noticed‚Ä¶
Post Body:How positive Christian Wood has responded after seeing his minutes get cut recently? Since our loss against OKC (a game in which he  played 20 and a half minutes) he‚Äôs played less than a combined 20 minutes over the next three and was  a DNP vs the Suns 

But how could this be? Wasn‚Äôt the narrative bro a locker room cancer? 

But but the elite analysts  over on NBA Reddit told me he would cause issues if he didn‚Äôt get enough/consistent playing time‚Ä¶

More fuel was added to the fire when he told the media Ham said he would have a big role‚Ä¶.Those same analyst (who are also super insiders)  jumped all over that sound bite 


Welllllll it‚Äôs looking like that narrative was just  more bullshit spewed from the media and fans‚Ä¶and some of yall echoed those same numbnuts too. Quite frankly, you should be ashamed of your self üòÇ


We are only a little over a quarter into the season, and although his playing time has been reduced, he‚Äôs been one of the biggest hype men on the bench. This is especially apparent when Bron scores. When Bron did that 360 lay the other day, He and Hayes and others befuddled reaction was hilarious. Another funny moment was when Bron scored on Booker and flexed after and Christian mirrored him. Shit he played less than 9 minutes last night in a game that was essentially over halfway through the third and didnt show any bad body language. No complaining no whining no passive aggressiveness or subliminal social media post, 

Now of course winning cures everything, and whose to say his response won‚Äôt change, in spite of that, but Ham deserves a ton of credit for being an elite communicator and very transparent with his players. Some coaches don‚Äôt have that skill so players are left in the dark about their playing time or role on the team.. Some decide to communicate with their head coach via an assistant coach. It‚Äôs what, in my opinion, can lead to locker room issues‚Ä¶.

TLDR: CW locker room  cancer narrative was bogus. Ham is a great players coach
Comment:Anyone have any idea why CW isn‚Äôt getting any playing time outside of garbage time?  I thought earlier in the season, he and AD tag teamed reasonably effectively in a twin towers lineup, and CW was putting in effort on D and especially on the boards.  It‚Äôs not like Jax is suddenly killing it or anything.  Also, anyone know what happened to CW‚Äôs offensive game?  He averaged closed to 18 PPG not that long ago, now he struggles to break single digits and looks uncomfortable with the ball in his hand, like he doesn‚Äôt quite have a go to move to score a bucket.
Comment:Fun topic and nobody is right or wrong cause we don't know the full story behind everything.  It could be anything. 

1) he is not cancer like what was mentioned. 

2) nobody is crazy enough to pout with LBJ on the team

3) Ham got through to him

4) Aliens
Comment:Thomas Bryant was the sane way and little did we know, he wanted out

I think Davis minutes can be cut a bit and give time to wood. There is room for Wood.
Comment:Everyone happy with minutes or lack of to win $500k prize. Best time to be bench warmer with Lebron doing all the heavy lifting üò¨
Comment:It‚Äôs cool and everything but let‚Äôs not speak too soon. Things have been going well and let‚Äôs hope it stays that way. Way too soon to starts bragging about it in posts.
Comment:Players have nagging little issues during the season that will see them missing games or reduced game time for stretches and then get back on the floor and start performing well again. Most of these things teams dont disclose or talk about. This is probably what is going on with Wood right now. Sometimes players just need to go through more conditioning especially at the start of the season.
Comment:He's definitely a good teammate
Comment:Ham would be literally the PERFECT assistant coach. I think he‚Äôs out of hid depth in terms of decision making as a HC, but the guy can convince even the most stubborn players to do anything.
Comment:Ham plays who plays defense vando and jaxson are back of course his minutes will go down it‚Äôs really nothing to talk about because it‚Äôs so early in the season
Comment:Yup...I absolutely love seeing him hyped up on the bench whenever there are great playes from the team. I don't see him pouting at all. I hope this lasts the rest of the season because there will be games when we will need his skillset.
Comment:He‚Äôs used to it.
Comment:I‚Äôm patiently waiting on the ‚ÄúWOOD GAME‚Äù
Comment:I really like when Wood and Hayes play with each other, you can tell they like each other a lot because they are constantly trying to get the ball to each other and joking/laughing when they mess it up half the time lol
Comment:Pretty sure Wood knows he could be out of the league at any moment if he lets his attitude get in the way after this offseason
Comment:Well it is In Season Tournament too so if they are winning he is happy about 500k his tune could change if he is not playing and they are losing.
Comment:Ham is a great players coach
Comment:2 ‚Äúplayoff‚Äù type games where teams tend to shorten rotations and go smaller.

With any injury to LeBron/AD/Rui, Wood becomes essential.

In fact, imagine a situation where AD is out extended time during season and needs to make a full recovery before playoffs. Wood can be a big part of securing enough wins to *make* the playoffs.

Alternatively, what if AD went down in the Finals or Conference Finals? Wood is a player that could give just enough to patch that hole on the ship and get the team over the top for a W or 2.

Point is: he is not factoring into the core rotation for the playoff group, but situationally and rest-wise he will play plenty this year and (as I just said) is an immensely talented big to fill in during injuries.

He‚Äôs like that big we are always desperately coveting at the trade deadline, but he‚Äôs already on the team and getting familiar with the players/system.
Comment:This is one thing that Darvin Ham has and that is he knows what it feels to be a player especially a key bench player or a bench warmer. He knows how it feels when you're getting playing time or a DNP. He understand what the players feel.

He may be a fine to sometimes good tactician but his demeanor as a players coach speaks for itself.

I'm around CJ's age and remember thinking there was something special about him due to the crazy hype he was getting. I'm sure CJ, a kid who clearly liked basketball felt it too. Must be wild for him to be able to go up against that same guy he remembers from when he was 11.

Post Title:We get blinded by his offensive output, but this game is a defensive masterclass by AD. | Lakers now top 5 Defrtg tied with okc
Post Body:
Lakers now is t-5th Defense rating
9-8 vs .500 teams (tied most wins vs .500 teams)


Given the energy depleting effect Bron gave the pels, my dawg AD also disrupted bunnys at the rim for pels making em miss layups for his contests. Zion had a couple lays on him but thats it. Without him i honestly believe atleast 10 games played will be L's

The AD slander is so blown out of proportions when he is this good defensively. Especially bums like Stephen A on tnt postgame whining abt younger dudes not being fit unlike Lebron, AND has the audacity to point it AD smh.. i thought the criticism was on Zion for underperforming.. i swear the coverage on AD not commending his defense, as consistently as they talk shit on his offense is overblown.

Thank you Jesus for AD. Deserves a shit ton more respect.
Comment:The last 3 games we are the first in defensive ratting.
Comment:In traditional stats I think he's 2nd in rebounds and 1st in blocks last time I checked. He's a monster.
Comment:Most of us dont get blinded. Anyone who knows anything never talks about his lack of defense. He always brings that. Its just his inconsistent offense is much more noticeable in a league w offensive dominance and on a team where AD is tasked with being a 1A from time to time.
Comment:Honestly, I don't mind the inconsistent offense as long as he shows up consistently on the defensive end which is what he's doing this season.

Our team has enough offensive firepower as is.

AD is obviously going for the DPOY and I absolutely love it!
Comment:I rarely, if ever, criticize AD.

LAL fans and the general mainstream media ask too much from him. They keep calling him "inconsistent" when **he drops statlines like 15/15/5/2/2 on 50% shooting (while still doing amazing defense beyond the box score).**

They praise Gobert (who's pure defense) and Bam (just a worse, albeit younger, version of AD).

They praise all kinds of bigs over AD, when really only Embiid is a suitable comparison (both brilliant at offense and defense when playing at their best, but Embiid has a way deeper offensive bag).

We don't need more from the injury-prone to AD to win-it-all. We just need him to stay healthy and do what he does. What we really are missing is a tertiary scorer, quality backup bigs, quality playmakers (other than Bron), and 3-pt shooting.

**AD's stats and defensive effort are more than enough to satisfy the role of 1st- or 2nd-best player on a championship team. He's better, for example, than EVERYONE on the Pelicans.**
Comment:we need to start making some noise so he can win dpoy
Comment:He also gets shat on so much for missing time but he‚Äôs 1st in the entire league in total minutes played right now.
Comment:Had to walk back a lot of my hate this morning.. without All Defense defense game would‚Äôve been to close for comfort.
Comment:when was the last time the team have the MVP and DPOY in the same team?

Rodman x Jordan? no? not sure.
Comment:WE knew AD is the best defensive player  in the league but what really has impacted this defense other than him is Cam Reddish.  Dude actually being good is a real positive.
Comment:I hope he gets DPOY man üîí
Comment:He goes underappreciated even in this sub
Comment:If he plays most games and we have a top 5 record he def gets dpoy
Comment:Exactly. If we are winning and AD is dominant on defense, it's fine
Comment:It's DPOY season üí™üèº
Comment:People say he's not alpha personality type or "taking the torch" from Lebron, but he dominates every game on the defensive end. 

 AD is actually a power bottom.
Comment:is a reminder that he's also an incredible team player. His ability to create opportunities for his teammates is often overlooked. It's not just about the points he scores, but the impact he has on the entire team. Truly a superstar in every sense of the word.
Comment:Lakers had 67 points at halftime and people were crying about him only having 6 points.
Comment:And we've played the majority of the season without our full defensive unit and Lebron coasting on defence because his energy was needed on the other end.

I think top 5 underrates us.
Comment:Better get that DPOY award he badly deserves this year
Comment:Not 'We'.
Comment:ADPOY szn is here üò§üî•üôèüíõüíú

Basketball gods please keep him healthy and it‚Äôs his!

Comment:Got smoked by 2 elite teams and beat a bunch of scrubs. It's early though and team is mostly healthy now. I wouldn't want anything to do with the Lakers in a 7 game series if I were the other teams out there.
Comment:This would‚Äôve looked even better if they had managed to squeeze out that Sacramento and Dallas game
Comment:Separating Austin and Dlo in the starting lineup and starting Cam was the key. 

Could‚Äôve won some of those early losses if they started the season that way so technically the Lakers are the one seed ü§ì
Comment:dang didnt know we are this good
Comment:3 of those losses on b2bs too I think , if only we got the Mavs game or AD stated heakthy vs Miami till later we‚Äôd be legit in the hunt for n1 seed if minny falters . Minny almost lost to spurs other night but spurs suck
Comment:Due for a loss according to that pattern
Comment:And we already have clinched the season series against the sons
Comment:Three of those losses were off a b2b.
Comment:I just watched Jason Timpf Hoops Tonight and he belives the Lakers will make a trade on the deadline for a two way player particularly the PG position.
Comment:All 4 of those losses are against good, cohesive teams. And 3 of those 4 losses were blowouts.

We still have a lot to prove, but we're definitely playing much better than before.

Comment:Audio was trash.
Comment:The Pelicans weren‚Äôt the only ones that went out the night before the game.
Comment:Pels coach yelling was the only thing that saved the game from Candace Parker‚Äôs awful commentary.
Comment:Candace‚Äôs dumbass really said that AD wasn‚Äôt an offensive player when he was on the Pels‚Ä¶dude averaged 28/28/26 PPG in his last three years on the Pels. I swear her and Doc just say shit just to hear themselves talk.
Comment:Probably drunk/high af
Comment:The cameras and the angles were the only good part of the game. The sideline rail-cam that they had in the bubble was great. the baseline cameras when they were shooting freethrows and thh overhead angles were top notch.
Comment:Hated the mic'd up coaches and sound mixing. Hope they fix it for next time cause that was not it
Comment:I have watched basketball for 12 years now and I am pretty sure this was the worst basketball watching experience. From courts to commentary to mic'd up coaches. Horrible. Plain horrible.
Comment:At one point Candace said ‚ÄúLebron is a billionaire because he knows the value of 500k‚Äù. Call me crazy but I understand the value of 500k and I‚Äôm not a billionaire. I‚Äôm barely a thousandaire.

Post Title:‚ÄúLaKeRs oNLy bEaT bAd tEaMs‚Äù
Post Body:I knew this narrative was obviously untrue but I didn‚Äôt know how untrue it was
Comment:OK that is true but look at some of the actual context tho...

3 wins against teams that are .500 not above: 2 vs Houston who has not won a single road game in LA.  Hou also curb stomped LA in Houston with AD out. And the Clippers who were on the second night of a back to back &amp; down 4 rotation players including a starter from the Harden trade &amp; then Harden didn't play... plus they have westbrick so automatic +10 LA lol.

Cleveland was a good win but they lost Garland after 14 min &amp; replaced him with a 2 way player in the 2nd 1/2 going from 70 point 1st half to 51 in the 2nd. 

3 wins against Phoenix missing either Beal, Booker, or both &amp; we all saw what happens when you have 3 max contracts and don't get any production from 1 or more of them. The last one with Booker &amp; KD I'll agree is a good win.

Good win against Orlando at home but then smashed in Orlando... and while they've started the season well they are far from a proven team.

Great win last night vs Nola who has been playing good ball &amp; healthy... maybe spent too much time in the casinos &amp; clubs ü§∑üèæ

And I definitely give them some credit for playing without varying combos of rotation players but all secondary players. The opponents who have played LA with missing players were usually star or at least starter level players. So I would say 7 of those wins were with the deck stacked in LA's favor. But you can only play the teams in front of you.

My problem is whenever the Lakers have had a chance to really prove their quality against a real contender or team likely to go far in the post season without a stacked deck they've been beaten handily... 6ers, mavs, kings, heat, nuggets were all either beat downs or botched at the end from winning positions. Both of those methods of losing reflect poorly on the coaches. 

Right now this team is underachieving based on the talent level. Until that changes I'll give ham his due credit which is coaching a team to underperform it's talent.
Comment:I don‚Äôt understand the narrative behind the upcoming game when Pacers just fucking beat the #1 and #2 seed in the East.. Boston and Bucks will be favorites in the playoffs and somehow if Lakers beat them they‚Äôll say they got lucky to play the Pacers‚Ä¶ logic
Comment:I think the narrative is that we lose to the best teams (and a few of them blowouts - obviously B2B plays a role) not necessarily that we only beat bad teams
Comment:Lol the excuse now was the Pels were hungover still from last night which might be partially true given it's Vegas

Comment:Best Defensive Rating in the League since Vando has been back, obviously 3 game sample size but:  
1. Lakers, 95.4 DefRtg  
2. Timberwolves, 102.7 DefRtg

The defense has been looking insane since getting our guys back.
Comment:We're like 12-4 with fewer than 4 rotational players out too.
Post Title:Lakers lineup data vs the Pelicans (12/8)
Post Body:TLDR: Wrote a program that parses the website [popcornmachine.net]( for games, aggregates +/- and minutes for specific lineups.

[lineup data](

Observations:

The two lineups I've been complaining about all year, Dlo-Cam-Prince-Bron-AD, and Dlo-Reaves-Prince-Bron-AD were our two best lineups. Although I still don't think those are the best lineups going forward, I gotta admit I was wrong here and those guys killed it.

All around good game, I think everyone played well tbh. Not much to criticize.
Comment:I think how unusual this game was makes this data mostly noise. We already know the second line lineup doesn‚Äôt work well defensively. We already know that Cam in the SG spot does. Real question is whether prince is better replaced by vando or rui. The answer is probably matchup dependent.
Comment:Prince was amazing at both ends and made the lineups way more effective than they have been.

Post Title:How should we celebrate if the Lakers win the In-Season Tournament?
Post Body:The concept of a mid-season tournament is foreign to fans of only American sports but the concept is common overseas. For instance when a club in England wins the FA or League Cup they have a parade.

Part of the reason why the FA Cup is such a big deal is the prestige, it pre-dates the Football League the League Cup isn't as old but it's still prestigious. Is it too fresh and novel for a big celebration?

I'm conflicted. There's an argument we deserve one because we were robbed of one by Covid.

.... Whatever the case if the Lakers win I'm counting it as the tie-breaker with the Celtics. For trolling purposes.

Comment:RIOT
Comment:Robustly and recklessly?
Comment:It‚Äôs too early to tell if it‚Äôs a serious thing. Imagine if there was a preseason championship, would that be worthy of celebration? Point being, a tournament win isn‚Äôt necessarily a worthy achievement.

We‚Äôll need to see things like how far do tourney winners go, compare stats in tourney games vs playoffs, etc‚Ä¶

What if Boston and Indiana meet in the playoffs and the Pacers get swept, how much stock can we put in this thing.
Comment:I think the celebration shouldn‚Äôt be too huge. But let this give our players the confidence to win in the playoffs. Let this be a momentum gainer. Let them know how bright the lights are on a do-or-die game. How they should be preparing and locked in for each game in the playoffs. This serve as a winning experience for all, from our first time head coach (on how to prepare for games) to our players who‚Äôve never been to the playoffs
Comment:I think it‚Äôs pretty messed up that winning the final won‚Äôt count on the regular season standings. I wish they‚Äôd reward the winning team with something more like automatically being 1-0 in the first round if they make the playoffs
Comment:When‚Ä¶
Comment:I'm going to be pretty fucking stoked I can tell you that

Comment:I‚Äôve been saying all year long it is just about getting healthy, the team was missing too many energy/defense/rebounding guys.

Comment:For what being lebron‚Äôs assistant ?
Comment:![gif](giphy|3o7TKwmnDgQb5jemjK)
Comment:Ham didn't have to do much coaching tonight since it was a blow out. Just because he was vocal micd up doesn't mean much that was never his issue. This game was over early so his job was easier tonight. No need for in game adjustments really. No need for crucial timeouts. I'll give him some credit for the rotation splits with implementing back the returning guys.
Comment:This fucking sub. Lmao.
Comment:Will give pockets!!
Comment:I saw him catch the ball. First time I‚Äôve seen him with his hands out of his pockets.
Comment:Nah

When he wins a title then he deserves more respect than Vogel.
Comment:I don't care what this sub, Twitter or IG says, but this man is a very good coach who is still learning.
Comment:Getting a W and your star players play 23 mins, keep it going.
Comment:NO
Comment:IMO he‚Äôs not the perfect coach but he really meshes well with Lebron and the rest of our roster. He kinda takes a backseat and lets Lebron run the show (for better or worse) but everyone plays hard for him (when healthy)
Comment:I did. I saw with my two eyes how dangerous this man is when he took his hands out of his pockets and started working the refs, turned out he's supreme in gaslighting refs. The man got the ref to pay attention on fouls committed to Lebron and refs called everything perfect tonight. Respect !
Comment:Give Lebron respect for his greatness.
Comment:Coaching analysis can be so lazy.

Not every win is automatically good coaching, not every loss is automatically bad coaching.

Look at this man‚Äôs total track record. He‚Äôs still bad with rotations, timeouts, challenges, and just generally not having a cohesive offensive strategy.

Can he get better? Sure. He‚Äôs a second year coach, but it‚Äôs still a huge risk having someone like this lead a championship contender. Boston is dealing with the same problem.
Comment:My guy needs to learn how and when to call a damn timeout
Comment:The best part of this sub is that what we say has no effect on the game, positive or negative.

Comment:maybe we can rent it out to the Clippers
Comment:Damn straight.
Comment:Eh, as a European, Cups are important here.

We have Leagues and Cups, there are the two major domestic tournaments we play for (European collective comps are there too, but i'm talking specifically domestic ones) 

So i see this tournament as the NBA Cup so for me, personally, it's an important trophy, especially as the first one in history.
Comment:I think it'd be funny if we hung every single banner and displayed every single trophy we've won all around the arena.  I wonder what that'd actually look like.
Comment:I wouldn't mind hanging the banner since it's the first one and, whether you like the tourney or not, it's history. If this was any other year I would be more inclined to agree.

Comment:Adam Silver calling in the A-Team, the Lakers ain't winning. This shouldn't have come out or been said until after.
Comment:The "in season tournament" is dumb af with an even dumber name. I'd be embarrassed to hang anything to do with this disaster.
Comment:Hang it in the clippers locker room.
Comment:How about a mini parade
Comment:I think we should , because it‚Äôs the first one . If we win it makes it a bit more special  imo being the n1 franchise + being first in season winners
Comment:Hanging a smaller banner for winning the first ever IST would be kind of nice.
Comment:Give it to the Clippers so they can hang it in their new arena. Make them feel more at home.
Comment:You are absolutely right! BUT I ask this question:  If the Lakers do win the inaugural In-Season Tournament and the 1st NBA Cup on Saturday then eventually hang a banner for it does it raise the tournaments importance beyond money and bragging rights? At least from a fan perspective, does the Lakers hanging the 1st tournament banner make it seem more important or more prestigious than if the Pacers winning and hanging a tourney banner?

I feel like with how much Adam Silver wanted this tournament the NBA would want them to.

Comment:One less banner for the clippers to cover up during their games.
Comment:As I said before, I hope they treat this trophy like the WCF trophy and not touch it and leave it in Vegas, like they left that one in Denver during the Kobe-Shaq era (and the Magic era).  Just take the cash and move on.

And BTW, I STILL don't care about this tournament or trophy and all of these NBA shows and sports talk can't make me.  Just want the Lakers to win games period.

Comment:Hopefully we pull a gang of these and have nice table decorations all over the office.
Comment:Can we get a parade?
Comment:Of course not. It‚Äôs a marketing tool to make games more competitive. It definitely accomplished that. But it‚Äôs not a Larry O‚ÄôBrien trophy.
Comment:Hello drsk_phoenix
Post Title:LeBron James.
Post Body:30 points 
5 assist 
8 rebounds 
9/12 FG
8/8 FT
4/4 3PT

All of this UNDER 22 MINUTES. 

Lebron was the first player in LAKERS HISTORY to be the fastest to get 30 points.
Comment:Damn this is great.. wish I had one but as Kobe but this is pretty cool
Comment:LeFurry
Comment:Baa baa baa
Comment:Haters gonna say its AI
Comment:LeBron on pace to be a top ten all time scoring laker by the time he's done, despite all the injuries

He's already the leading franchise scorer for the Cavs, by about a mile

Oh he's also #4 all time for the heat.  Only played there 4 years.

Comment:I thought about the NBA finals too, haha.  Stoked on the game tomorrow!
Comment:Totally looks lik Reggie and bean
Comment:You realize the young gun beat the old head in that one, right?
Comment:It won't be easy. Carlisle is a legit coach and he'll dissect our lineups and have them ready. Hopefully Ham is doing the same.
Comment:Lakers in 1!
Comment:Haliburton ain't there quite yet...

Comment:And we will wipe them like we did 23 years ago

Post Title:GOAT James
Post Body:
Comment:Only thing I can kinda say is he only lost stamina? During his heat days he could go all night game after game but as he progress you can see he load manage himself more and more in game. 

That's about it. Amazing to think that's all he gotta do to maintain being one of the best.
Comment:Nobody has the work ethic or dedication.
Comment:incredible hot (room temperature) take
Comment:I think we start seeing players playing longer and longer. In fact its already happening. LBJ proved its possible
Comment:Hea playing like his sons life on the line
Comment:The other day when LeBron said father time was undefeated and he's just trying to hand him 1 loss. 

IMO, he already has handed father time a loss. We've never seen a player at this age dominate the way he has and still be a top 5 players (fight me, I said top 5) in the league. From this point on, it doesn't matter what the hell happens to him. Whether he gets injured or its a gradual decline; he has won the battle against Father Time. Nobody is supposed to be this good at this age.
Comment:Remove ‚Äúthis late‚Äù and it‚Äôs perfect
Comment:*That's the goatt!!*
Comment:Everytime I think that he's showing his age, he does crazy shit like this
Comment:No player has been this great for this long ever. GOAT
Comment:It‚Äôs insane he hasn‚Äôt lost a step, really makes you think he might have 3-4 more years left (in the league). He‚Äôs quality enough I don‚Äôt see a drop off coming in 2024-2025 season
Post Title:Who's your MVP for the Tournament??

Comment:If we win it, it's got to be lebron. Nobody really else in the convo from our team.
Comment:Bron obviously
Comment:I‚Äôm assuming this will only be given to teams that make the finals (or win it)

But if a team lost in Semi Finals but the player DOMINATED group stage (like 50pt Triple doubles) would they be eligible for the award or is this basically like IST Finals MVP, is there a Championship MVP?

Comment:If we had Hakiburton we‚Äôd be a dynasty lol , sadly he‚Äôll probably carry Indians but I‚Äôll root for him whenever we don‚Äôt play them kid is fun . Much rather watch his style of ball vs guys like Luka or trae  or sga even (other great pgs)

Comment:We may need to retire his jersey

Comment:Anyone see the pregame interview with Reaves? Is it just me, or did he seem pretty stoned haha
Comment:It's crazy the Lakers get healthy and u don't see too many fire Darvin ham comments lol anyways this team if they make shotsThe Lakers  will tough to beat against anyone they now have the wings to defend anyone and with the best defensive player in the league in AD The Lakers can definitely win a title this year gotta stay healthy though
Comment:Bron daring Zion to shoot was amazing. It threw him off completely
Comment:We have the squad. Can we please stop with the trades convo. This is the squad, and we haven‚Äôt even seen it‚Äôs full potential. Wait til Gabe is fully healthy. If Gabe plays for us like he did in MIA‚Ä¶. OMG. We got the size, we got the lengthy arm Defenders, AR is starting to really look like a magician with the ball handling‚Ä¶.. this is the squad.
Comment:Vando's D is just too immaculate
Comment:LBJ 30 piece on a 22-minute night. GOATed
Comment:Jalen Hood-Schifino with the season shooting splits of 22/12/50

Including Summer League, he's shooting 19% FG (9-46) and 10% from 3 (2-19). No idea why the Lakers haven't sent him to South Bay to get reps up and see what potential he has to unleash. Colin Castleton is putting up monster numbers (20/11/4/1/2) this season while we're left to wonder whether JHS can even be the second coming of THT.

Comment:Glad to see Christian Wood in high spirits despite only playing minimum minutes

Comment:watch out indy you about to face LeFinalBoss you gotta have a generational team or jjbarea on your team to beat this guy
Comment:Lebron is not playing about that 500k üòÇ
Comment:Seems dumb that we still have to play the Pacers twice if the next game doesn't count for anything other than prize money. One of those games later in the season should just be dropped.
Comment:Everybody on the Lakers scored in the game!
Comment:All Lakers were +6 or over. That‚Äôs wild. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seem that before. Not a single player with a minus.
Comment:Zion is ass man. 1/6 on free throws TWO rebounds and THREE turnovers. What a waste

Comment:We beat a legit over .500 team and Lebron went 100% from 3 tonight. This is a time to celebrate! LET'S FUCKING GO! üíúüíõüíúüíõ
Comment:So this is what happens when we have a semi healthy roster
Comment:Look what happens when Lebron has the confidence he can afford to get fully involved on both ends.  

We've just hammered two decent teams in a row (yeah the Suns score was close, but only because our finishing - and I literally mean the very last action after creating a good look - was trash.  That's just variance.)
Comment:AR the second-leading scorer on this team with 17 points on 94.4% TS%.
Comment:Easy W for the Lakers. Love to see it
Comment:I remember when pelican fans thought they were getting wemby from us lol
Comment:Prince's 3pt shots finally going in!
Comment:What is going on with Woods?
Comment:We just dismantled them holy shit that‚Äôs a good win
Comment:Haha the TNT crew generously gave about 10% of the post game coverage to Lebron and the Lakers before moving on to the much more pressing topic of how bad Zion is.
Comment:LEFINAL AND UNDEFEATED!
Comment:LeBron is the GOAT.

Lakers with wings back is dominant.

Comment:I‚Äôve been questioning if Troy Brown Jr was better than TP but I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs been shooting better now lfg
Comment:Tp is the most underrated pick this season for the lakers
Comment:So valuable on this team none of our wings can shoot like him with his quick trigger
Comment:Prince was playing pretty poorly on both sides until he started hitting his shot. He really needs to score to be fully engaged on the other end of the court.
Comment:TP for my bunghole!
Comment:Here's my apology for tonight. I hope he can continue to produce from 3.
Comment:He a 8-ply TP
Comment:This sub wouldn't give him a single chance. I'm been a Prince believer since we got him, I've always loved his game and I'm so happy that tonight was the night he went off.

It's not like he waited till we were up 30 to start making shots either, he was there from the get go and a huge reason he pulled ahead
Comment:TP means Two-way Player
Comment:He was sooolid tonight. Great fcking job man, we want to see that often
Comment:People will focus on the O but his defense was great tonight
Comment:Glad to see some recognition of Taurean. Dude puts in work, plays solid D, and knows his role
Comment:All the rash reactions to struggling players. Glad to see him knock down shots.
Comment:It's amazing how much his shot has improved now that he doesn't have to play too many minutes and take the toughest defensive assignment every time.

Post Title:Look at how they‚Äôre guarding AD and tell me what y‚Äôall expect him to do
Post Body:He‚Äôs making sacrifices with this offensive system. When teams play him man with little help he catches the ball and drops 20 in a half like he did the other night and when they switch up their defense to respect the fact he is unguardable, it‚Äôs on the others to knock down open shots. Put some respect on his name. They‚Äôre only as open as they are because of his orbit.
Comment:This is what some of the people from this sub don‚Äôt sees.

Opposing teams usually game plan against AD.

So sure, he won‚Äôt get 30 or 20 points consistently. And that is ok.
Comment:Shoot a middy? Man‚Äôs open
Comment:Hit the open man
Comment:To be fair it‚Äôs 3 on 5
Comment:I have no idea but that court is atrocious
Comment:I really find this discourse of AD being unreliable offensively really dumb.

Yes, sometimes he doesn't look for his shot.

Yes, his jumpers aren't going in.

But defense is our identity and AD is the posterboy of that. And you are right, the Laker shooters have to knock down their shots or we won't go anywhere.
Comment:I want him to keep doing what hes doing. He made the right play like a real star and found ways to contribute
Comment:I expect him to jump from where he is standing and posterize the whole opposing team
Comment:I expect Reddish to cut for either an open dunk or draw in the defender from the weak side and get Prince open.
Comment:[Have some higher standards and expectations from a franchise player](
Comment:Shoot that midrange.
Comment:That‚Äôs y he needs to get his middy back to at least serviceable level or if not needs to be in a deeper position constantly where if he catches the ball he doesn‚Äôt have to dribble 3 or 4 times with a loaded up defense to get a good look. AD should have the quickness to still put direct pressure on defenses as a scoring threat even in looks like this, that‚Äôs what makes him a unicorn for bigs
Comment:Dribble and step back fader
Comment:Dunk on dem foos
Comment:Make the middy like he always used to.
Comment:Drive and kick out.
Comment:Do we not think that guys like Embiid, Giannis, Jokic are seeing this look basically every time they touch the ball?
Comment:Push mid paint and post while the trailers catch up. Help defense collapses and you have open shots somewhere.
Comment:AD had an amazing game
Comment:Giannis, Embiid and Jokic get guarded like that non excuse for AD
Comment:People really trying to trash on AD for this game huh? Why am I not surprised laker fans
Comment:He was missing shots and still getting doubled on the catch.

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't matter, his defense was monstrous tonight. He was covering everybody and a big reason our defense was so good tonight. Chasing everybody, challenging everything. Getting tons of rebounds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Great performance without having to score a lot
Comment:I‚Äôm dropstepping on JV after one dribble and doing a dream shake. AD IS SOFT
Comment:You took a screenshot before 2 of the lakers were even up the court yet lol of course they are gonna be on him.
Comment:Crossover, spin move, into an up and under layup. Easy buckets
Comment:AD draws defensive attention, shooters got open looks and guys have space to cut. Then they respect the shooters and AD eats in the 3rd. AD could've had about 8 assists tonight too, he was passing really well. Even if he's not scoring, he's making offense easier for everyone else.
Comment:Hijacking your picture to ask the Demar crowd - what would Demar do? Defense is standing right where he‚Äôs best at


AD needs shooters
Comment:Make shots
Comment:Make the right play and pass it to the open man like he‚Äôs been doing, fuck the box score watchers
Comment:Don't blame him today. He didn't fall off
Comment:Park his butt closer to the basket. Play inside out game.
Comment:Stop making excuses game ain‚Äôt over
Comment:Facts he gets swarmed in the catch. I‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs he‚Äôs been able to pass well. It‚Äôs leading to cuts and open shots for others
Comment:That defensive strategy is a big reason Lakers are shooting the way they are tonight. It won't always be accurate like this, but it's nice to see

I want to buy the Cam Reddish jersey but [they don't seem to sell it any more]( Does anyone know where I can find one? Thanks in advance

PS: If there is a way to buy it in LA I‚Äôd like to know it as well. 
Comment:I got Reaves. It took almost a month before I got it. I bought it on the NBA store.
Comment:I bought mine on global nba store (vanderbilt ofc)
Post Title:Why does the TNT broadcast have the player/coach audio?
Post Body:Not sure if I'm just hearing things, but why did the TNT broadcast of tonight's game have the coach/player audio? It was so annoying hearing, "B! B! B! I GOT BRON!" and then also having Kevin Harlan and Doc Rivers ü§£
Comment:I couldn‚Äôt believe how Willie Green was yelling at his NBA players ‚Äúget your hands up and get your hands out‚Äù just like my hs coach, mans out there yelling at them ‚Äúgrab the rebound!‚Äù Etc. I feel like that would get real old for pros but in hindsight maybe he shoulda yelled ‚Äúshoot the ball in the rim‚Äù
Comment:Shows how stupid people who say Ham isn't doing anything are
Comment:I just wish they would turn down the volume slider by ~30% lmao he loud af
Comment:Darvin Ham: Low low low

like Flo Rida
Comment:It‚Äôs annoying AF.
Also underscores Ham just doesn‚Äôt say a whole lot.

Candace is really good, too. Send Doc home.
Comment:Can they use that Pixel 8 technology to eliminate the coach noise? ü§£
Comment:They said they had the coaches mic-ed up.
Comment:It‚Äôs the commentary table üòÇ
Comment:I like it. Gives us insight on what the coaches are yelling. Mostly heard Green, but Darvin was talking too.
Post Title:Does LeBron still drink like he did a few years back?
Post Body:It may seem like a strange question but he looks SO spry. I refuse to believe he's still hitting that wine like he was during 2020-21. I remember him talking about it a lot in post game interviews. Does he still do that? Because I feel like there's just no way he drinks regularly and is looking like this...unless those grapes got the elixir of life in them.
Comment:He‚Äôs the leanest he‚Äôs ever been. In great shape 

I bet he weighs around 240-245
Comment:I think it‚Äôs more to do with his foot healing than anything ‚Ä¶ he was on a tear before that injury last season too.
Comment:He love him some Spanish wine
Comment:Once again‚Ä¶..LeBron looked like this during the November - December stretch last year before he got hurt. Stop with the short term memory.. it happens every year
Comment:I don't need the subs in yet my heart won't take a comeback tonight
Comment:My guess is, he‚Äôs not drinking that Ralph‚Äôs Rose, like us peasants.
Comment:Lebron gonna splurge his 500k on some premium aged whine.
Comment:I dont think a glass or two of wine is gonna phase Lebron and his crazy ass workout and recovery regimen
Comment:Remember, he's been playing with nagging injuries for the most part over the last few seasons. The shin stuff, ankle etc. In one way or another, he hasn't quite been at 100%.
Comment:Only tequila now
Comment:Whatever hes drinking i need some
Comment:Red wine has a ton of antioxidants and is fine in moderation. I don‚Äôt think LeBron has ever had an issue or addiction with alcohol. He probably still drinks high end red wine here and there with dinner but I doubt he ever has more than 1 or 2 in a given night and probably only occasionally during the season. Yeah maybe he has some nights in the offseason where he drinks a few glasses or even a bottle to himself on a rare night that he decides to go heavy but again his workout regiment is probably pretty insane
Comment:Idk I‚Äôll ask him at the podium

Comment:WE ARE SO BACK
Comment:Always nice to win vs the Pels Dynasty ü§£
Comment:One more
Comment:On a more serious note: should there be a ticket/expenses refund to the losing team's fans, when their team not only loses, but actually doesn't play basketball in a game of basketball? As a lawyer, I'd call it breach of "contract"; as in you buy a ticket to a basketball game expecting to see your team play basketball.
Comment:Q1 we gave them a body blow that stunned them but they were able to maneuver back into the fight.

Q2 LeBron delivered a nasty hook that knocked the Pelicans down. They were slow to get up and a nasty wound opened up.

Q3 The blood kept flowing and the Pelicans couldn't see straight. They got weaker and weaker as the game progessed.

Q4 The Pelicans limped to the loser bracket while being beaten up with a ton of body shots.

Game really ended in Q2 with that nasty LeBron run.

Post Title:NBA Rumors: Bulls 'Hesitant' to Trade Alex Caruso amid Lakers, LaVine, DeRozan Buzz
Post Body:Personally, AC and Drummond the only two in Chicago I think are worth calling about. If AC isn‚Äôt on the table, I‚Äôm not interested.
Comment:Good, we don't need this one dimensional player.
Comment:We ain‚Äôt trading D-Lo or AR!
Comment:They can keep losing them
Comment:Nah man. He's OUR success story. Makes me sick thinking pqyin THT over AC. That's messed up then, even more now
Comment:Where has the interest in Drummond come from? All of his issues with being slow when he was here earlier wouldn‚Äôt have gone away
Comment:AC is the only candidate those other two can go somewhere else via 3 team deal or something. In Rob I trust.
Comment:Maybe they're talking indirectly to Pelinka Lakers with the "our greatest success story" BS. This is them saying we want more. They know this will piss off Lakers fans who want him back
Comment:Drummond?? Like Andre Drummond???? PASS
Comment:Driving up the price. Keep him.
Comment:Hence why they‚Äôve been a poverty franchise. This would make ZERO sense. 

If you‚Äôre rebuilding, why would you hold onto an almost 30 year old role player whose stock has never been higher?

^(I just want Caruso back home, idgaf about their future)
Comment:Hate Drummond
Comment:Then we are hesitant to send JHS for Lavine and Caruso either
Comment:Good. I'd say the Lakers should stick to what they have and focus on getting everyone healthy. I believe the current roster can go all the way if healthy.
Comment:If we gotta get rid of reaves I‚Äôm not down
Comment:This is probably posturing because the Bulls would be brain dead to blow up their team but not trade arguably their most valuable asset.  LaVine, DeRozan, Vucevic are all better players but not every team needs them, especially on their contracts.  Caruso is making $9M and I can guarantee EVERY contender could use him
Comment:Would love an AC reunion, but Cam and Vando give us insane versatility as on ball defenders. They can smother and keep up with small guards because of their size and speed. And they can defend Wings. Idk idk
Comment:Drummond no. Been there, don‚Äôt that. He‚Äôs empty stats.

Caruso is a proven winner, stats or not.

Vincent and a 2nd or JHS take it or leave it.
Comment:Always thankful for the Bulls as they are the easy counter to the ‚Äúonly big markets win‚Äù narrative nonsense.
Comment:Lol
Comment:Bulls ARE NOT trading Caruso to us. They will shove Lavine down our throat and if we don‚Äôt bite then that‚Äôs it.

They believe if they move Zach for the right pieces then they‚Äôll retool and not rebuild
Comment:They going to clippers for one of the future toilets at their new arena
Comment:I feel like he will end up on there Mavericks for some reason
Comment:AR, AC, Vando, Bron, AD would be niceee
Comment:Part of me thinks that the team does not need Caruso
Comment:I stopped reading after Drummond.
Comment:they just trying to up trade value or something.. Bulls are in rebuild whether they like it or not, should give AC a chance to fight for another championship. Either with Lakers or another team.
Comment:If we can somehow get Caruso back that would be the dream but as for LaVine I‚Äôm not sold but watch him get traded and ball out
Comment:Bulls pushing this lakers narrative hard. Woj says he has no market or suitors. Shams keep saying lakers lakers like we suck or losing. Only way lakers even consider lavine if he comes with first round picks back.
Comment:Lmao tf is the point in keeping him if they‚Äôre rebuilding?? He 29 &amp; will be 30 in February
Comment:LaVine is too big of a contract to trade for, the Lakers should only be looking at Caruso, if they're looking to trade at all.
Comment:‚Äúarguably this regimes greatest success story‚Äù

Nah I‚Äôm sick to my stomach, no way the Bulls are claiming Caruso as their success story
Comment:He's one of THEIR biggest success stories? Lol wut? He blossomed here. They just paid him.
Post Title:Rant about us never wearing purple uniforms anymore
Post Body:I couldn't remember the last time we wore our purple uniforms (even if they're not even that nice), so I went back to the [NBA LockerVision]( site and apparently we have only worn our purple uniforms one time this season: November 8 against the rockets. 

So not only did Nike ruin our gold jereseys, they also basically abandoned our purple jerseys.

So much for "purple and gold".
Comment:Fun fact: Jack Kent Cooke hate the word ‚Äúpurple‚Äù so he made Chick say ‚Äúforum blue.‚Äù
Now thx to Nike they are blue.
Comment:I dont like white jerseys at all
Comment:That shit ain't purple. It's Forum Blue.
Comment:I don‚Äôt really mind, considering how much I hate our current purple uniforms.
Comment:It used to be so simple.. Gold for Home, Purple for Away, and Dress Whites for Sunday games with some throwbacks sprinkled in here and there .. no idea what's going on now...
Comment:There‚Äôs so many jerseys now that I don‚Äôt even remember all the designs. Missing the good old home/away arrangement
Comment:PURPLE AND GOLD FOREVER!!!!
Comment:I miss the old sunday home games = white
Regular home = gold and 
Away =purple
Comment:Yeah the forum blues are always my favorites
Comment:I wish we could go back to the era where every team has a home and away jersey. The Lakers wear authentic gold at home, and purple on the road. Simple. Nike f***** it all up
Comment:I absolutely love the white uniforms
Comment:Our current set of jerseys is the worst rotation we've had in years. 

Weird highlighter yellow aint it, white is too soft, the city editions are blatant cash grabs. Bring back the seasons we had the throwback blue MPLS ones or the cursive blue, those are automatic
Comment:The jersey selection is made by the actual teams themselves and not Nike. Home team gets the priority and the road team selects a contrasting color. I‚Äôm hoping us not wearing the purple much means that we‚Äôll be phasing out that terrible black stripe after this season.
Comment:Pretty fucking stupid we got special tournament jerseys now we can‚Äôt wear them after making it to Vegas, when the hell are we gonna wear them again? I feel like they finessed those of us who bought these city jerseys, we‚Äôre only wearing them for 3 weeks! Cmon man that‚Äôs gotta be some of the dumbest shit ever I wish Lebron and them conjoined to pay the fine and just wear our IST jerseys for the remaining rounds it‚Äôs dumb as hell we don‚Äôt wear them im the semi‚Äôs or finals.
Comment:I would care more if they were our old purple unis. The current ones are terrible and I'm glad they don't play in it as much but wish we had our old school jerseys back.
Comment:We mainly play in our gold or white. I quite like the white, and if I‚Äôm honest I don‚Äôt miss the purple uniform.

Comment:For the uninformed.


Comment:Mr. Handsinmypocket
Comment:Let me add a comment here saying while I have my qualms with Ham I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a TERRIBLE coach or anything like that. I didn‚Äôt notice this clip in slow-mo last night and wanted to post it here because I thought it was funny. 

Let me ALSO clarify I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs funny that they went away from the set and ran their own play, but LeBron and ADs reactions at near the same damn time is pretty funny and speaks to their chemistry as teammates.

Forgot this is the internet where everyone thinks you have an agenda or are some type of idiot for posting a clip gah damn.
Comment:Why is Ham pretending like he actually knows how to coach? Hes only a hype man
Comment:Yeah stars do this on every team but Brons face displays a unmistakable palpable look of lack of respect for Ham in that moment. As funny as it is, as a whole it's not a good sign for the teams overall success :/
Comment:Even the players know that Ham is trash.
Comment:Prince's reaction was mine. It was probably Ham's too. 

Bron's been waving off coaches for 20 years.
Comment:I saw that shit in real time!  As soon as Ham put the marker to the board Lebron was like nah, next.
Comment:Lol bron does this to all his coaches including SPO. He even out coached SPO during the 2020 finals. Stop pushing a narrative
Comment:Yall be mad at Ham when Bron is the real coach
Comment:They've learned some of that Pocket lessons that when it's go time, it's not Ham's time.
Comment:Ham play was probably shit anyways.

Post Title:The AR-Vando-Rui-Bron-AD lineup in the first quarter
Post Body:The AR-Vando-Rui-Bron-AD lineup was our best performing lineup against the Suns, to my surprise. I watched their short stint in the first quarter to see what worked and what didn't.

Off poss 1:

[offensive possesion 1](

AR and AD run a pick and roll at the top of the key. AD sets a good screen, so AR‚Äôs defender is behind the play. Rui‚Äôs defender, Grayson Allen is not in a position to help. Vando is actually setting a back screen for Bron. Although this doesn‚Äôt make that much sense because why are you setting up a LeBron corner 3, I really like the thought process, and it actually works to freeze Booker for a second, as he hesitates as to whether he should switch over to guard Bron. This leaves a wide open paint for AD to drive in and hit the push shot.

Def poss 1:

This is what excites me about this lineup. Vando starts on Booker at the top of the key. Booker runs a pick and roll, and Vando/AD actually miscommunicate here whether it is a switch or a hedge, but Vando is able to recover onto the ball. This is helped because Rui is sitting in the paint, blocking Eubanks path to the rim. Eubanks passes out to Nassir Little, Bron‚Äôs man, and Vando and Bron just switch again. Little runs a DHO for Booker, and Vando and AD just switch again. Booker tries to drive on Vando and just gets fucking clamped. That possession was beautiful. With Vando, Bron, AD, Rui switching everything, providing help defense, just a completely cohesive unit with no advantages generated by Phoenix. 

Off poss 2:

Lakers in the penalty so Vando splits two free throws.

Def poss 2:

Vando starts on Booker again. This time when Booker calls for a screen, they instantly switch. Once again, they can do this because AD can guard Booker, and Rui and LeBron are providing paint protection. Booker actually drives by AD, but runs right back into Vando, and has to kick it out. Bron closes out hard and gets beat, but Little dribbles back into Vando and out of bounds.

Off poss 3:

[offensive possesion 3](

Unfortuantely, this is where some of the problems arise. I included the image to illustrate the spacing issues. Vando‚Äôs man, Booker, is completely ignoring him and in the paint. Rui‚Äôs man, Allen, is mostly out of the action. Okogie is a little too close too, but realistically, Allen and Okogie won‚Äôt affect the play that much. LeBron takes a fadeaway jumper here that misses. 

Vanderbilt gets the offensive rebound however, and LeBron drains a three. So overall not a bad possession, but potentially a cause for concern.

Def poss 3:

[defensive possesion 3](

Booker tries to push the pace in transition, but drives straight into Vanderbilt. He‚Äôs forced to shoot over Bron and Vando‚Äôs contests and misses. Tiny nitpick but I‚Äôd like Rui to secure these rebounds. I thought he did an excellent job of this last playoffs, but recently he keeps getting the ball poked away. Need him to grab them with force.

Off poss 4:

[offensive possesion 4](

This was a pretty bad possession. For some reason, Rui and Vando are in the same corner, and both of their men are guarding AD. I think this play should have been a cross court pass to Rui with AD and Vando setting elelvator screens, but that would require pre-planning. Rui and Vando just shouldn‚Äôt be in the same corner. AD gets the ball and can‚Äôt score on three guys.

Def poss 4:

[\\"aye we not doubling in open gym bro\\"](

And this is why you practice doubling in open gym.

&amp;#x200B;

[offensive possesion 5](

Off poss 5:

So actually in this possession they subbed out Vando for Dlo :(. But I wanted to include this because it does kind of show how insane this lineup would be if Vando could shoot, or if we traded for a 3 and d wing. Booker is now guarding Dlo, so look at his position here compared to the other three offensive possesions. Grayson Allen not helping off of Rui, so Eubanks had to shift over, leaving AD wide open for the dunk. Beautiful basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

Observations (TLDR):

This lineup is beautiful defensively. The size and versatility just lets us switch on every screening action. Considering the fact that 99% of offensive tactics in basketball are predicated on advantages coming off of screening action, the ability to swtich everything essentially without any disadvantage is insanely valuable. Not only is AD's ability to guard on the perimeter invaluable, but the help defense provided by LeBron and Rui help mitigate any potential losses around the rim. It's just perfect.

Offensively, we got some problems. Unfortunately, that probelm is Vanderbilt. His lack of gravity just stifles a lot of the Lakers offense, especially because LeBron and AD like to operate in the paint. As you can see in the one possesion that they took Vando out for Dlo, the spacing looked completely different. I think some of this can be schemed, with Vando setting back screens or DHOs on the weak side, but we'll have to see what the coaching staff does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopes:

I just want to see this lineup more. I want to see the Lakers find a way to use Vanderbilt in the offense, whether that be as a screener or lob threat or wtv. Everything else, Reaves, Rui, Bron, AD were simply perfect.
Comment:Dlo was terrible tonight
Comment:AND HAM REFUSES TO RUN IT AGAIN WHAT A FUCKING JOKE
Comment:Too bad this lineup and all others still feature Darvin Ham as coach...
Comment:Not surprising at all, that‚Äôs our best lineup period
Comment:AR just does better off the bench. I think he likes coming in so there is no stardom on him being a starter.
Comment:Great work. I‚Äôve said it multiple times that Vando is not
Playable when it matters until he fixes his 3pot shot. Could be surprise trade bait:
Comment:If we actually had a good coach who knew how to hide Vando on offense its GG
Comment:Yeah need the coaching staff to do more than just stick vando in the corner on offense. The defense is beautiful. Great writeup.
Comment:Some of the "same spot on the floor stuff" can also likely be chalked up to guys getting back into the swing. This is only Vando's 2nd game and Rui's 1st back from injury. 

I am encouraged by what I've seen offensively. Still wrinkles to work out, but there's potential in these spaces. And defensively I'm sold 1000%. This team can be an elite defensive unit with hounding, in your face pressure.
Comment:damn im @ work so i can‚Äôt read all this but looks good OP üëç
Post Title:Every offensive and defensive possession of the Lakers starting lineup in the first quarter
Post Body:**Starting lineup possessions**

The Lakers starting lineup of Dlo-Reddish-Prince-Bron-AD was a -7 against the Suns. -12 of that came during the third quarter, in which it was rather obvious that it was not working. I wanted to analyze the +5 in the first quarter, to see if that stretch was really them at their best, or good results despite bad process.

If you want to skip the descriptions of the possessions, I give my observations for each player below. 

Def poss 1: 

Booker runs a pick and roll with Nurkic, Reddish is behind the play, AD hedges at the 3pt line. Nurkic doesn‚Äôt roll, and instead screens Prince for Durant. Prince dies on the screen, KD gets an open 3. BAD POSSESSION.

Off poss 1:

Bron AD run a pick and roll. Notice Gordon and Nurkic are both paying attention to LeBron, so Grayson Allen has to cheat off Dlo to cover AD. Booker also cheats off Prince, and Prince was wide open for 3. Instead, LeBron passes full court to Dlo, who makes the 3. The pass to Prince was probably a higher percentage 3, but Prince has been kinda ass form 3 this year. 

Def poss 2:

KD and Booker run a DHO, and Reddish and Prince switch the action. Booker easily beats Prince off the dribble, causing Dlo to have to rotate or else give an open layup. Booker makes the right read, but Dlo deflects the ball, and the Suns get called for an offensive 3 seconds. Turnover.

Could have been a bad possession, but saved by Dlo.

Off poss 2:

They run the same play as the first possession, but why are Cam and Prince in the same corner? This is a coaching mistake. Grayson Allen recognizes the ball is going to Dlo and contests, and he misses it. Once again, Prince‚Äôs man is helping on the Bron AD pick and roll action, and the counter should be to kick to Prince for the open 3, but both the Suns and Lakers recognize he is not playing well. 

Def poss 3:

Durant drives and pulls up on Prince. Cash. Lakers kind of didn‚Äôt get back in transition, but on the other hand, Prince could have played much better on KD knowing that AD was behind guarding the rim. BAD POSSESSION.

Off poss 3:

This possession is just confusing. The floor is pretty well spaced out, and they give AD the ball on the low block. He has his dribble, and could easily drive on Nurkic for an open layup or kick it out to Prince if KD collapses, but he takes a contested midrane jumper? BAD POSSESSION. 

Def poss 4:

Booker runs a pick and roll, Cam dies on the screen and Booker gets to his spot and hits an open midrange jumper. Bad screen navigation, bad possession. 

Off poss 4:

LeBron does well to get separation off Gordon, and then drives to the right baseline. But look at the floor he is seeing. Prince‚Äôs man KD has one foot in the paint and is ready to jump to protect the rim. Reddish‚Äôs man Booker is fully in the paint showing a body to AD. Only Dlo‚Äôs man can be considered ‚Äúout of the play‚Äù. Bron takes a midrange jumper, miss. Bad spacing, bad possession.

Def poss 5:

Suns post up Booker on the left side. AD helps? I guess he doesn‚Äôt trust Cam in iso, but that leaves Nurkic wide open to cut to the basket and he makes an easy layup. BAD POSSESSION.

Off poss 5: 

LeBron and AD run a pick and roll. Booker and KD are in the corners, and finally don‚Äôt help off of Cam and Prince (which can be considered a defensive mistake considering how much they got away with it for the last four possessions). Gordon dies on the screen and is behind the play, and Nurkic can‚Äôt choose between guarding LeBron or AD so easy layup. GOOD POSSESSION.

Def poss 6:

Booker runs a pick and roll with Nurkic, and Cam gets caught way behind the play. He is not even a factor. However, AD plays insane defense and contests Booker‚Äôs shot, causing him to change his mind and turn the ball over. These kind of plays don‚Äôt show up in the stat sheet, but are what make AD the best defensive player in basketball. Cam was completely out of the play, and AD was long enough to be guarding the roll from Nurkic but also contest Booker‚Äôs shot. Insanity.

Off poss 6:

Bron pass out to Dlo in transition, score.

Def poss 7:

Prince is guarding Nurkic in transition. (???). Cam comes to double, and the Lakers are stuck in rotation. I chose this frame cuz Allen had a wide open pass to KD under the basket, but it ends with Booker getting a step on Bron and him fouling. 

Def poss 8:

Out of the foul, Cam gets caught out of the play after two screens from Nurkic and Allen. Dlo is forced to double, Booker makes the right read and kicks it out to Allen for the open 3. Bad possession. 

Off poss 7:

Dlo beats Booker off the dribble, KD collpases, and Prince makes an excellent cut and layup. Great possession.

Def poss 9:

KD beats Prince off the dribble, AD has to cover KD. KD makes the pass to Nurkic, so LeBron has to rotate, but he blocks Nurkic at the rim. This is a bad possession that was saved by LeBron/AD. 

Off poss 8:

Dlo and AD run pick and roll, Reddish‚Äôs man, Grayson Allen, comes to help on the action, so Dlo kicks it out but Cam misses. This spacing is also atrocious. This is why you can‚Äôt get away with running lesser shooters around LeBron and AD the way you could other teams. They primarily operate in the paint, so their defenders will also sag off of them. Look at where Booker is standing relative to Prince, there is no driving lane to the rim. 

Def poss 10:

Cam makes an excellent steal, he deflects Booker‚Äôs pass into Allen. Laker ball. Great possession. 

Off poss 9: 

Cam crashes into Nurkic and draws two fouls. Idk about this call but we get two free throws. 

Def Poss 11: 

Cam gets caught way behind the action, Booker drives on AD. Even though he misses, Cam and AD‚Äôs momentum is carrying them backward because Cam was out of position, so Booker scores anyway. 

Off poss 10:

Bron and AD run their pick and roll, and KD helps off Prince. Bron doesn‚Äôt pass to Prince though, and passes it out to Dlo to reset. Dlo and AD then run pick and roll, and AD gets the and-one. 

Def Poss 12:

Cam gets caught on the screen again, Booker misses a wide open midrange shot. Even though they didn‚Äôt score, this is still a bad defensive possession. 

Off poss 11:

LeBron finds AD right under the basket, and he just smokes the layup. He makes that kinda shot 9/10 times though, so this is a good possession.

Def Poss 13:  
 Grayson Allen drives on Dlo and tries a bank shot? This is definitely more awful offense on the Suns part than good defense from the Lakers. 

Off poss 12:

LeBron finds a cutting Prince right under the basket. Beautiful pass, great possession.

Def Poss 14:

KD drives past Prince, so Dlo comes to help. KD passes out to Allen, but he was out of bounds. Not good defense by the Lakers, this is bad offense from the Suns. 

**Observations for each player (TLDR):**

Dlo:

His primary role on offense is as a spot up shooter or as a secondary playmaker. During this stretch he did that perfectly, hitting 1/2 threes and making two assists. He held up decently against Booker on one possession where he was switched on a late clock, he held his own albeit against Grayson Allen, and provided decent help defense. Nothing exceptional, he just did his role relatively well.

Cam Reddish:

Cam was tasked with guarding Devin Booker, and he was ok during isolation, but really struggled navigating screens. Booker was able to get to his midrange shot so much, he just missed them. Cam made a few really nice defensive plays as well. Unfortuantely he did absolutely nothing offensively, his man is consistently cheating off of him to help on the Laker's on-ball action. LeBron and Dlo are either not looking for him because they don't trust him, or when they do pass to him he missed. Essentially, he was good making defensive plays, but bad at containing the action in general, and bad offensively.

Taurean Prince:

Prince was awful defensively, dying on a screen on the first possession, and consistently getting beat off the dribble by Booker and KD. He wasn't providing much on the offensive side either in terms of spacing, as his man similarly helped off of him, but he did make two really nice cuts. Essentially, he made two nice cuts but he was awful pretty much in all aspects defensively, in iso or screen navigating, and not providing any spacing whatsoever.

LeBron James:

He's great. What can I say. When he actually give a shit and is trying on defense, I have no criticisms. Four assists and three steals (two of them I'd say is credit to AD but still he was good on defense with regards to rotating).

AD:

Best defensive player in the world. The shit AD can do on the defensive end is just insane. He missed a few bunnies at the rim, sure. But his overall defensive impact saved so many plays. Cam and Prince aren't playing crazy good defense, they are consistently getting beat, whether that be off the dribble or getting caught on the screen, but AD is just saving their asses.
Comment:Damn you kinda make good point. So you don‚Äôt think it would some of the same issues running a two big line up?
Comment:I‚Äôm wondering, given our personnel, if the Lakers ought to run a defensive scheme more akin to the Heatles trapping scheme. With Cam Vando and D‚ÄôLo on the outside (PLEASE SEND TAUREAN BACK TO THE BENCH HAM) that‚Äôs a ton of length, and AD is the best free safety in the NBA on defense. It would compensate for our best defenders struggling to navigate screens
Comment:Prince should be replaced by Vando or Rui in the starting lineup.
Comment:Did you mean to link stuff here? You referred to screenshots but I don‚Äôt see any. Interesting breakdown tho.  

It‚Äôs not a coincidence that the starters ortg with Christie is way better than Cam, he‚Äôs a legit threat and defenders don‚Äôt sag off of him nearly as much. The starters with Christie have a net rating of +15.5, with Reddish it‚Äôs -5.0 (in similar minutes too)

I just don‚Äôt understand how Christie‚Äôs minutes are getting cut after showing that he‚Äôs more valuable than Cam when Cam‚Äôs shot is not falling. In his last 5 games Cam is 1/10 from 3, there‚Äôs no reason for him to have such a long leash when Christie is right there. I feel similarly for Prince.
Comment:Thanks for taking the time to do this. The national media will continue to shit on AD, I've heard podcasters making the case that Gobert deserves DPOY over AD because even though AD has better stats in every category, Gobert 'alters' more shots.

You can never stop dumbshit haters from being dumbshit haters. But it's nice when this community steps up and tells the truth so at least the readers here will know how full of shit the media is.

Even if Lavine has been phoning it in a times, that's not a redeeming argument. At best, the only thing Lavine has over D'Lo alone is scoring. D'Lo probably a better defender at this point (yeah, really...) is a better passer, and is a WAY better stabilizing force for the team.

Then throw in Rui, one of our top bench scorers on top of D'Lo? Nah. Forget about it. Lavine and his obscene contract is NOT worth them both.
Comment:Lavine just disappears on games take it as a Bulls fan plus his shot selections are terrible.
Comment:Come on ,we don‚Äôt need lavine who plays no defense
Comment:No way they messed up this squad
Comment:Its dumb to even consider it. Dlo's impact goes beyond his stat sheet let alone adding one of our depth is even ridiculous for a player who isnt making a big impact on his current team and being ticky-tacky with his injury.
Comment:We need someone who can score in Playoff under pressure defense. Lavine or DeRozan are not our answers esp losing Rui and DLo.
Comment:Stats never tell the full story.

IF we turn a corner and keep on winning, we don't give up our "depth."

But if we keep on getting humbled in embarrassing blowout defeats to every good, cohesive team...

Then we might have to cash in some of our chips for an All-Star / legit 3rd option.

Or, more generally speaking, we might need a trade or two to truly become a contender. However, I don't think anyone is currently fixated with LaVine, in particular.
Comment:Lavine would be another project as he would be asked to play defense here. No one has any real idea if he will fit because he hasn't done that before.  Smells too much like the Westbrook experiment for my liking. 

We should really be looking at AC even if we have to overpay. Nobody would want to play the Lakers with that kind of defensive lineup.
Comment:Keep our team and run with it bro we went to the wcf with less this teams better literally just hoop I love caruso to death but he‚Äôs not needed rn
Comment:With Reddish/Vando/Rui all healthy now we don‚Äôt need Lavine 

Don‚Äôt wanna fuck w chemistry either
Comment:They need to just keep this team together imo.
Comment:Pls no
Comment:It ain't happening, Rob has been talking about maintaining continuity and doing this trade will set us back even in terms of chemistry. Not worth it.
Comment:It's clearly obvious that lavine is a high risk low reward bet at this point. His skillset doesn't even fit what the team needs.

I am fairly concerned because this FO had clearly shown that it can make bad decisions on trades/personnel.
Comment:Zach is mostly just a scorer... I think you have to go off last years stats when judging him though.  Theres nothing about the bulls thats right this year and they just don't seem to play hard this year.
Comment:People really overrating Zach Lavine's fit with LeBROW lmao you'd think he's Steph 2.0 or something
Comment:I'm sure those who suggesting this trade are just bulls fans in disguise.
Comment:No
Comment:It‚Äôs a big, big game against a very good team. Will playoff DLO show up?
Comment:Yup. This ain‚Äôt it. God damn. The fit is better than when we got vampire.


But shit pls god no
Comment:We do not need another max contract on the books, especially when it‚Äôs an injury prone guy who hasn‚Äôt won anything in his career either
Comment:I dont love the trade but the point is we cant play either guy at the end of games when we need our best line up.
Comment:Dlo and Rui don‚Äôt even close for us and they‚Äôre not consistent enough scoring wise. I‚Äôm becoming more and more open to a deal for LaVine and Caruso if it means we can get a more consistent scorer to take some scoring pressure off Bron and AD. This way AD can focus more on defense since that‚Äôs clearly what he‚Äôs best at, and Bron can conserve more energy and reduce the risk of injury. Caruso would only further improve our POA defense and slots in perfectly for the playoffs.
Comment:I agree I‚Äôm glad someone else realizes this as well.
Comment:Bulls fans want him gone
Comment:I don‚Äôt think the team should trade for Levine, if anyone it should be Caruso and I still don‚Äôt wanna give up Rui or DLo for him.
Comment:I'm seeing DLo and Rui are both playing really well and a good part of the reason the Lakers, with their extremely hard start of season schedule, are doing well.

It would be insane to trade them.
Comment:We don‚Äôt need a trade
Comment:I was excited to start the season because it truly was a "Let's run it back" year. We got key pieces back with a full training camp and time to really build chemistry. I want to see if this squad, as currently constructed, can take it all the way.
Comment:I‚Äôm not an advocate for trading for Zach but using this seasons 10 game stats is so pointless. Zach has shot the ball and scored as efficient as anyone in the league over the past 3 years. He would probably be great next to lebron and AD
Comment:If the FO did this, Lakers deserved to miss the playoffs
Comment:Why would i want an injury prone star that refuses to play literally any defense. No.
Comment:If Zach was younger and less injury prone I would consider it but depth is gonna be key for us to make a run this season not three stars. Team chemistry plays a big role imo and I want to keep the continuity from last year
Comment:We have a lack of playmakers on the team, losing dlo for lavine ain't the right move
Comment:Yes lavine is more talented but imo the Lakers need healthy bodies and that depth. The Lakers don't need to have another question mark week to week
Comment:For all the trade haters out there, In the playoffs Reaves and Dlo can easily be taken out of the game with athletic smart defenders. Then you will only have a hot&amp;cold AD and a 40 year old Bron for offense. Recipe for disaster.
Comment:Lavine is overpaid, don't play D and did nothing in playoff
Comment:The team needs to see how it looks all healthy before u gauge anything else.
Comment:D'Lo is starting to show why he wants to stay here. He may have a had bah shooting night on Tuesday, but his defense is starting to shine. Rui has always been efficient and a huge help. especially when he has Lebron on the floor with him.
Comment:The only person who should be pursued for a trade is Alex Caruso
Comment:What if they throw in Caruso???
Comment:I don‚Äôt think this trade makes us a contender or even past the conference finals, so it‚Äôs not worth it.
Comment:Hell no, I want AC rather
Comment:I would be down for the trade if reaves has shown he can run the point fulltime but he hasn't i would pasd
Comment:Saying ‚Äúall he has over him for scoring‚Äù is like saying the difference between Seth and Steph curry is a bit of scoring. Lavine has been a first option the past three years and has averaged 27, 25 and 25 all on 60% true shooting. The difference in Lavines ability to get to the rim and shot create for himself is huge, and he does it all without AD and bron drawing attention. The gap between lavine scoring ability and dlo is fucking massive. Dlo as a first option would absolutely fucking tank his averages. We‚Äôve seen him as a first option in the past and it was horrific. If you give lavine lebrons playmaking and AD as another option he‚Äôs going to destroy teams. They won‚Äôt be able to guard all three, which also means we can get away with playing guys like vando more when they would normally end up getting benched due to lack of offense. We won‚Äôt have to worry about that with an elite shot creator on the floor. 


Dlo can‚Äôt even be trusted to close regular season games lol people seem to gloss that part out like we are going to be cool with our starting point guard being benched in playoff games because he‚Äôs such a weak defender (which is even funnier you try and claim he‚Äôs better than lavine‚Ä¶). Lavine is a better defender he has Vuc and demar guarding the paint instead of AD lol 


As for rui I like him and he‚Äôs fun to root for. But he‚Äôs not enough to fix our offense and he‚Äôs not a star. People are just overrating him like they do all lakers players.
Comment:Zach has more  talent in his right pinky than both Rui and dlo combined.
Comment:The worst part about it is that Bron and Reaves would be the main ball handlers
Comment:I'm against the trade but being objective,  the worst thing about a trade is his contract. If he was making enough to just trade dlo for him, that be decent gamble since they both provide things we need. Dlo is obviously the superior playmaker but Lavine is the way better athlete and would provide the rim pressure no one else on the roster can give except lebron, lavine is also not a terrible playmaker. He's also having a down season as a shooter but is historically a really great spot up shooter. 

With that said, the trade makes no sense with his bad contract and us needing to gut the team to acquire him, plus maybe even adding a pick. It's a pass from me
Comment:All I take from this is DLo is really averaging 17 ppg on nearly 50% from the field and 40% from 3s and people still hate him despite getting only $20 mill/year.
Comment:Post Title:Shams mentioned that Zach LaVine is scheduled to return around mid-January, coinciding with the time D'Angelo Russell and Rui Hachimura become eligible for trade üëÄ
Post Body:Based on DLo‚Äôs inconsistency and Rui‚Äôs lack of minutes I do think both of them will be on the trading block (I much rather get ride of Prince than Rui), but I don‚Äôt think Lavine should be the target
Comment:After watching last night, they can keep Lavine and stick him where the Sun doesn't shine
Comment:Shams and Clicks101 go hand in hand when it comes to Fan Dual
Comment:We already got rid of the Albatross Westbrook contract, and we want to add another?
Comment:This is gonna be another Russell Westbrook scenario. A guy making $40+ mil and if underperformed will get crucified forever LMAO.
Comment:This man is crazy bro. Woj literally just said bulls have no market or real suitors but yet he keep pushing this lakers narrative. Who gonna start at point if you trade dlo. I fucks with shams but pushing this narrative for the bulls is obvious. Because guess what ok you want dlo and rui for Zach. We want a two first rounders with him. One for cap relief you getting and another for taking that contract and increasing the tax bill by 50 plus million.
Comment:Hell nah. I don‚Äôt even think Rob is worried about a big trade anymore. Lookin at this team healthy it seems all we need now are minor tweaks. I‚Äôm even fine with keeping Dlo. I think JHS timeline fits with a rebuild around AD so if a nice deal came in for him for a score first gaurd or some extra size to do what we wanted Jax to do then I‚Äôm all for it. I saw glimpses of championship defense against two of the best scorers this games got so this team no longer needs to wait for the Dlo overhaul package anymore imo.(barring injury)
Comment:Keep our roster. Add around the edges if anything. Have we not learned from this third star bullshit? We have a great roster right now and I‚Äôd like to keep it that way.
Comment:Please don‚Äôt trade for Lavine. He‚Äôs not a significant upgrade over Dlo and Rui.
Comment:No thanks. Been down this road and it leads to nowhere fast.
Comment:absolutely not
Comment:Fuck that guy last thing the lakers need is a injury prone high salary player.
Comment:This is gonna be another Westbrook trade isn‚Äôt it?
Comment:Nooooooo man rui is untouchable.  You trade dlo for him ad is gonna regress and be pissed
Comment:If the Lakers are still hovering around .500 maybe. But still it doesnt resolve Lakers issues
Comment:Lavine only for Rui and Dlo and whatever picks they want is not worth it. The only way I‚Äôm taking Lavine is if Caruso is included.
Comment:Mods please make it stop
Comment:Trade rui and 29 1st for og anunoby that‚Äôs as fair as it gets. It seems like scam doesn‚Äôt plan on ever starting rui so he might as well trade that contract and get us a real 3nD starter not Prince
Comment:I‚Äôd rather keep DLo and Rui than get Zach.
Comment:Fuck no

No world in which Lavine is worth D'Lo and Rui. Fuuuuuck that noise
Comment:Please tell me who‚Äôs willing to give D‚Äôlo, Rui, JHS and picks for LaVine.  Nothing against LaVine personally but he‚Äôs owed ~$43M/year for the next 3 years, is NOT a playmaker, a bad defender, and offensively inconsistent game to game.  

Is he better than D‚Äôlo or Rui individually?  100% but this is the NBA where contract and roster builds matter.  You‚Äôre dropping your most consistent playmaker, averaging 6.5 assists on 1.7 TOs.  Now you‚Äôre relying on Reaves as primary PG (an area he‚Äôs been shaky this year) and putting a heavier load on Lebron.

Not only that you‚Äôre essentially stuck with LaVine for the next 3 years given his contract, the new CBA rules, and his trade value.
Comment:Ham goes before Rui
Comment:If we trade for LaVine I‚Äôm not watching another Lakers game for the rest of his tenure
Comment:Lavine is all glass bro.
Comment:I will go out of the popular opinion and say I‚Äôd rather have lavine than dlo. Straight up player for player. I will also say what we would need to give up isn‚Äôt worth it. 


The iffy thing is giving up rui. The only argument for it would be rui is under utilized.


The iffier thing is lavine being payed like a number 1 option for 4 more years
Comment:Not a good deal. I like Lavine well enough, but would not love this trade.
Comment:He's not the answer and neither is Caruso if it guts our depth which it will.
Comment:Fuck lavine, he‚Äôs on a terrible contract
Comment:if you wanna trade them fine but not for fucking lavine
Comment:They trying to use the lakers as leverage like they always do. 

The lakers brass is looking at this and laughing their ass off. 

Good depth/chemistry &lt; ball dominant shot chucker
Comment:I wouldnt mind trading dlo and Rui for a good player‚Ä¶ but not Lavigne
Comment:The fact the guys Chicago want aren‚Äôt trade eligible right now, and everything from our FO has been ‚Äúwe‚Äôll wait and see, not interested right now‚Äù makes constant mention of this trade really annoying. 


This has to be distracting to the team as well. And for no reason since a trade can‚Äôt happen for another 5-6 weeks
Comment:Stfu with this shit
Comment:aint no fucking way yall really gonna give up dlo rui and ar for lavine
Comment:Cost too much
Comment:Pivot to OG, Grant, or someone else

Trade Rui+Gabe and draft capital
Comment:Lavine would be a decent 3rd option but not at 40 million and not at the cost of Dlo/Rui. No thanks. 

Bulls should need to give up picks to get off that contract tbh.
Comment:No thanks.
Comment:Zach Lavine doesn‚Äôt move the needle as much as others want to believe.
Comment:DLO and Rui have been for us like when God made Manna rain in the desert for the Israelites. 

They can keep Lavine.
Comment:no one that even posts about lavine should be taken seriously
Comment:Thanks for keeping us in the tabloids shams.
Comment:It‚Äôs not happening and nor should it happen
Comment:Fuck that
Comment:The Bulls can keep him, I would prefer another player instead if they do decide to make a trade
Comment:Meanwhile the bulls are undefeated without LaVine üòÇ
Comment:So Zach lavine is going to play point gard ? Are they fucking stupid ? Tell me who is going to replace Dlo ? Bron year 39 ? 

Dlo inconsistency ? Wtf are you talking about he is the lead in assist and one of our best 3 pt shooter.

Comment:Told everybody that Vando will solve a lot of our issues on the defensive end. AD was able to show out offensively in the first half on Tuesday with Vando's defensive presence. AD wasn't able to score in the 2nd half cuz Vando didn't get any playing time. Seriously, Vando is our 2nd best defender and having him, Cam, and AD together makes us a defensive powerhouse. We just meed to find our offense and we're going to be a really scary team.

Post Title:Question about T-Mobile Arena seating
Post Body:I'm driving from SoCal to Las Vegas this afternoon for a three-day conference at Caesars Palace, which is a little over a mile from T-Mobile Arena. I hadn't thought until this morning of going to the championship game on Saturday, if the Lakers win tonight. I've been looking at seating charts and views from the different sections. I like to sit between the baselines. How are the views from the lower rows of the upper level? Seats in Row D of Sections 206 and 222 are available for around $400. The cheapest seats in the lower level between the baselines are around $1000, which is a bit less than the cost of staying four nights at Caesars.

Comment:I went to a conference there and had nose bleeds and the seats were still great

It‚Äôs a smaller arena so you should be fine
Comment:Not going to lie I didn't know Las Vegas had an arena comparable to those of NBA teams. I thought the games were going to be at UNLV or some raggity gym somewhere.
Comment:Lower bowls are much better
Comment:The upper deck is a hell of a lot lower than at Crypto. There's the lower bowl, one tiny middle section, and then the upper deck. Crypto has three levels of suites in between the upper and lower sections.

Comment:Hello. Can a kind soul explain to me how banners work in our arena?

I know that they hang the retired jerseys in the arena, and then theres also the 17 championship banners. But there are other teams that use this arena too right? So they have their own banners im assuming? And at some point Taylor Swift had her own banner as well? So how does the layout work then?

And do the clippers actually hang their division title banners?
Comment:Candace Parker...dammmmm
Comment:Just prepare for the sequel to last games internet meltdown if we win. I already know exactly what they‚Äôll say. ‚ÄúSilver didn‚Äôt want Pelicans vs. Pacers as the first In-Season tournament final so he made sure to rig it for the Lakers‚Äù. Can‚Äôt wait.
Comment:Wooohwee, the atmosphere feels like the playoffs.
Comment:Bucks: Giannis 37 and 10, Middleton 20 and 7, Lopez 18 and 6, Dame 24 and 7

High scoring output and they still lost

This shows you that you can have crazy offense from your starters, but if there‚Äôs not enough defense you‚Äôre not going to win
Comment:Bucks lose and everyone starts pointing fingers at the coach. Goes to show you that no fanbase is happy with their coach when they lose.
Comment:For anyone in the arena I‚Äôm curious what percentage is lakers fans? If it‚Äôs anything like summer league it should be a huge majority
Comment:Damian Lillard when he didn‚Äôt get the whistle late in game knew he was in for trouble 

This is why you don‚Äôt rely on refs for winning. Not to mention his lack of defense

This guy is r/nba top 10 player over LeBron/AD?

Comment:Lakers fans that actually watch games‚Ä¶ how do you feel about cam reddish?
Comment:Would straight up prefer targeting Jerami Grant over LaVine.  Both are clearly overpaid for a third-option but Grant is making $11M less per year, a better defender, and still adds a scoring punch.  

I‚Äôm still wary of trading D‚Äôlo purely because playmaking is a struggle for this team already.  Rui, Gabe or a Rui, Prince, JHS package works salary matching wise after January 15th.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think we should do it.  Our team is finally getting healthy, let‚Äôs see what this team looks like and hopefully we don‚Äôt even need a trade.  I just think it‚Äôs better than LaVine or even DeRozan

Comment:Expect Matt Ryan to shoot like Curry....
Comment:How expendable is Wendell Carter Jr for the Magic? He's missed 16 straight games due to a finger injury for the Magic and have still managed to be 3rd in the east with stellar defense. Goga Bitadze, Moe Wagner, and Isaac have filled in nicely in his absence. 

Only  13m and has been an average 3pt shooter for a center, but can actually hit the corner 3 at a decent clip. Weighs ~270lbs, for reference Jokic is at ~280. Top notch defender.
Comment:Post Title:In order for this team to be a true contender AD needs to be better offensively.
Post Body:Right now around 5/6 teams have at least two players averaging at least 23 points per game other than the  Lakers. Both Bron and AD averaging 24 points each is not enough this year. AD needs to at least average 28 ppg in order for this team to be a true contender.  He might be the best defender in the league but the team needs him to be better offensively.
Comment:I saw highlights of Embiid's last game vs the Wizards.  I wish AD had even 70% of Embiid's midrange jumper \*sigh\*
Comment:Then let‚Äôs get him a legit center so he‚Äôs not tired all
The time? Ya think it‚Äôs his fault he‚Äôs the only big lol and don‚Äôt count hayes or wood
Comment:AD‚Äôs relative ineffectiveness on offence stems DIRECTLY from Ham not calling for any off ball plays on his post ups. Watch any AD post up, fucking EVERYONE is just standing still.
Comment:He doesn't even need to hit jumpers he just needs to be active around the paint looking for post positioning. Also needs to be a better finisher around the rim.
Comment:This 28ppg number is pulled out of your ass.  Just like this sub has a hard on for 30 points.  It's so weird and random.
Comment:No he does not. Him anchoring the defense is way more important. Others need to step up
Comment:I know you were absolutely seething that Reaves hit that clutch shot vs the Suns
Comment:My only issue with ADs offense is how he basically dominates one half of the game and then just...disappears. 

I'd rather see him score consistently (like 6-7 points per quarter) than having him score 20 in one half and then 4 points in the next. 

Especially because players tend to get cold if they don't shoot the ball for longer periods of time. And we NEED to rely on AD in big moments from time to time. Not every game, but more often than not. Expecting Lebron to carry us every 4th quarter won't work in the playoffs. 

Opponents will just double-team him in the last minutes of the game and I definitely don't trust Dlo's offense in high-pressure moments.
Comment:This bum again. Why do the mods not ban him. Just look at his past comments.
Comment:We have a pretty well rounded team, imo, I don't think we need AD (or even Lebron) to put up a specific amount of points every night. D'lo and Austin can go off any given night as well, and that's not even touching on if Rui gets in a groove
Comment:Give him another PG then. He has been NBA's best finisher around the basket this season.
Comment:I am big fan of AD and thats because how much effort he gives defensively despite being one of the most talented offensive guys. You guys want him to be Hakeem %100 of the time but its not possible and even feasible for us. We have LBJ as option 1A and AD as option 1B offensively which is a perfect combo. On the defensive end though AD is option 1, 2, 3 and 4, thats how impactful he is and still manages to average 24 ppg while being the worst jump shooter in the league. When his shot comes around, we will be very scary.
Comment:He needs to start shooting threes again
Comment:Well, he will not be
Comment:This oddly specific opinion without any reasoning to back it up is silly.
Comment:Oh hey look, it‚Äôs Charles Barkley. No, in order for us to be a contender, our alleged three point shooters need to hit their shots. Because guess what that would do? Open the lane? You got it!
Comment:Perhaps you shld just tell him to be better offensively. It‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs never occurred to him in which case he might welcome the suggestion.
Comment:You're going to get downvoted but you're absolutely right. 

He's not bad at all offensively as he scoring 23 points per game on 53% FG. But he's also the worst midrange shooter in the league right now, hitting only 18% of his shots, that's atrocious . He's also missing too much easy layup and floaters the last few games. 

If AD can step it up offensively, he can bring this team to a different level.
Comment:I actually disagree. I think Lebron has to be your best offensively player like what we saw against the Suns. When the stakes are at their highest, LBJ doesn‚Äôt trust anyone but himself to takeover. Sure, he‚Äôll pass it off to Reaves during regular season games but that was after having 15 in the fourth. If you watched the 2020 Finals, Lebron forced (and made) a lot of difficult shots off isos and Game 4 was just a back and forth between him and Butler where he scored 40. 

Anthony Davis (in my opinion) will never be that guy 100% of the time. You guys are expecting an Anthony Davis that doesn‚Äôt exist. You can‚Äôt expect him to play elite defense while also scoring 30ppg every night. That‚Äôs a heavy workload on an already injury prone player. I don‚Äôt mind AD giving the team elite defensive effort while sitting around a guaranteed 23-25ppg. LBJ should sit around 25-27 and D‚ÄôLo and Reaves around 15 each. That‚Äôs a realistic spread in terms of work effort.

Comment:Happy for Matt Ryan tho he got a nice role on that team.
Comment:I miss that version of AD when people criticize they are doing it because he playing with BRON who has a lot riding every year. He can be that guy he is that guy but at this point mofos want AD to be that guy so Bron can be number 2. That version of AD looked like he was ready to take over but that just hasn't happened and he has gotten less diverse on offense. Obv he should be getting the rock at least 18-20 times a game but still his lack of motor is frustrating as well as his durability.
